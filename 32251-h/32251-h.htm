<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This primary text-book of applied physiology follows
a natural order of treatment. In each subject
elementary anatomical facts are presented in a manner
which impresses function rather than form, and
from the form described derives the function. The
facts and principles are then applied to everyday
life. Anatomy and pure physiology make clear and
fix hygienic points, while applied physiology lends
interest to the otherwise dry facts of physiology and
anatomy. From the great range of the science
there are included only those subjects which are
directly concerned in the growth and development
of children.</p>

<p>The value of a primary book depends largely
upon the language used. In bringing the truths
within the comprehension of children, the author
has made sparing use of the complex sentence. He
has made the sentences short and simple in form,
and logical in arrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
        A child grasps new ideas mainly as they appeal
directly to the senses. For this reason, physiological
demonstrations are indispensable. Subjects for
demonstrations are not given, because they cannot
be performed by the children; but the teacher
should make free use of the series given in the
author's advanced physiology.</p>

<p>Cuts and diagrams are inserted where they are
needed to explain the text. They are taken from
the author's <i>Applied Physiology, Intermediate Grade</i>.
Each was chosen, not for artistic effect, but because
of its fitness to illustrate a point. Most of the cuts
are adapted for reproduction on the blackboard.</p>

<p>The effects of alcohol and other narcotics are
treated with special fulness. The subject is given
a fair and judicial discussion, and those conclusions
are presented which are universally accepted by the
medical profession. But while this most important
form of intemperance is singled out, it should be
remembered that the breaking of any of nature's
laws is also a form of intemperance, and that the
whole study of applied physiology is to encourage
a more healthy and a more noble and self-denying
mode of life.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CELLS</h3>


<p>Our body is made of many parts. Its head
thinks. Its legs carry it, and its arms and hands
take hold of things. The leg cannot do the work
of the arm, nor the head do the work of the hand;
but each part does only its own work.</p>

<p><b>1. The simplest animal.</b>&mdash;Some animals have
parts like a man's; but these parts are fewer. No
animal has arms or hands like a man. A fish has
little fins in place of legs and arms, while a worm has
not even a head, but only a body, and yet it moves.
An oyster has only a body and cannot move. The
simplest of all animals is very small. A thousand
of them would not reach an inch. Yet each is a
complete animal. It is called the <i>ameba</i>. It is only
a lump of jelly. It can put out any part of its body
like an arm and take a lump of food. This same
arm can eat the food, too. It can also put out any
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
part of its body like a leg and move by rolling the
rest of its body into the leg. It can do some things
better than a man can do them, for any part of its
body can do all kinds of work. So the ameba
grows and moves and does as it likes.</p>

<i>b</i> A white blood cell.<br />
<i>c</i> A connective tissue cell.<br />
<i>d</i> A cell from the lining of the mouth.<br />
<i>e</i> Liver cells.<br />
<i>f</i> A muscle cell from the intestine.</p>
</div>

<p><b>2. Cells.</b>&mdash;A man's finger moves and grows
something like a separate animal, but it must
keep with the rest of
the body. A little piece
of a finger moves and
grows, too. If you
should look at a finger,
or any other part of
your body, through a
microscope, you would
see that it is composed
of little lumps of jelly.
Each little lump looks
like an ameba. We call each lump a cell. The
cells make up the finger.</p>

<p><b>3. What cells do.</b>&mdash;Each cell acts much as an
ameba does. From the blood it gets food and air
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and takes them in through any part of its body.
It also grows and moves. But the cells are not
free to do as they wish, for they are all tied
together in armies by very fine strings. We call
these strings <i>connective tissue</i>. One army of cells
makes the skin, and other armies make the bones
and flesh. Some armies make the fingers, and some
the legs. Every part of our body is made up of
armies of separate cells.</p>

<p><b>4. The mind.</b>&mdash;The body is a home for the
mind. The cells obey the mind. The mind pays
the cells by feeding them and taking good care
of them. When an army of cells is hurt, the body
feels sick, and then the mind tells the whole body
to rest until the cells are well again. When we
study about a man's body, we learn about the separate
cells in his body.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Our body is made up of many small parts.</p>
<p>2. The smallest parts are each like a little animal,
and are called <i>cells</i>.</p>

<p>4. One army of cells makes a finger and another a
leg, and so on through the body.</p>
<p>5. The mind lives in the body.</p>
<p>6. The mind takes care of the cells.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>OF WHAT CELLS ARE MADE</h3>

<p>The cells of our body are made of five common
things. You would know all these things if you
should see them.</p>

<p><b>5. Water.</b>&mdash;The first thing in the cells is <i>water</i>.
Water is everywhere in the body. Even the teeth
have water. Most of our flesh is water. Without
water we should soon shrink up. Our flesh would
be stiff like bone and no one could live.</p>

<p class="caption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <b>Fat tissue (&#215;100).</b><br />
The liquid fat is stored in living pockets.</p>
</div>

<p><b>6. Albumin.</b>&mdash;<i>Second</i>, next to water, something
like the white of an egg makes the most of the
body. The white of an egg is <i>albumin</i>. When
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
dried it is like gelatine or glue. Albumin makes
the most of the solid part of each cell. Lean meat
and cheese are nearly all albumin. When it is
heated it becomes
harder and turns
white. The word
albumin means white.
Dry albumin is hard
and tough, but in
the living cells it is
dissolved in water
and is soft like meat.
It is the only living
substance in the body, and it alone gives it strength.</p>

<p><b>7. Fat.</b>&mdash;<i>Third</i>, next to albumin, the most of
the body is fat. Fat does not grow inside the cells
of the body, but it fills little pockets between the
cells. Fat does not give strength. It makes the
body round and handsome. It also makes the cells
warm and keeps them from getting hurt.</p>

<p><b>8. Sugar.</b>&mdash;<i>Fourth</i>, sugar also is found in the
body. Sugar is made out of starch. When we
eat starch it changes to sugar. Starch and sugar
are much alike. We eat a great deal of starch and
sugar, but they are soon used in warming the body.
Only a little is in the body at once.</p>

<p><b>9. Minerals.</b>&mdash;<i>Fifth</i>, there are also some minerals
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
in the body. When flesh is burned they are
left as <i>ashes</i>. Salt, lime, iron, soda, and potash are
all found in the body.</p>

<i>a</i>, of potato.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b</i>, of corn.</p>
</div>

<p>Everything in the body is either water, albumin,
fat, sugar, or minerals.
These things
are also our food.
We eat them mixed
together in bread,
meat, eggs, milk,
and other foods.</p>

<p><b>10. Life.</b>&mdash;Our
food is not alive, but after we eat it the body
makes it alive. We do not know how it does it.
When the body dies we cannot put life into it
again. There is life in each cell.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The body is made of five things: water, albumin,
fat, sugar, and minerals.</p>

<p>2. Water is mixed with all parts of the body.</p>

<p>3. Albumin makes the living part of each cell.</p>

<p>4. Fat is in pockets between the cells. It warms
the cells and keeps them from being hurt.</p>

<p>5. Sugar is made from starch. It warms the body.</p>

<p>6. The minerals in the body are salt, lime, iron,
soda, and potash.</p>
</div>


<hr />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>DIGESTION OF FOOD IN THE MOUTH</h3>

<p><b>11. Food of the cells.</b>&mdash;All the cells of the body
work and wear out. They must eat and keep growing.
The food of the cells is the blood. Water,
albumin, fat, sugar, and minerals are in the blood.
The cells eat these things and grow. All food
must be one or more of these five things. Before
they reach the blood, they must all be changed
to a liquid. A few cells of the body are set aside
to do this work of changing them. Changing food
into blood is digestion.</p>

<p><b>12. Cooking.</b>&mdash;Cooking begins digestion. It
softens and dissolves food. It makes food taste
better. Most food is unfit for use until it is
cooked. Poor cooking often makes food still worse
for use. Food should always be soft and taste
good after cooking. Softening food by cooking
saves the mouth and stomach a great deal of work.
The good taste of the food makes it pleasant for
them to digest it. We must cut our food into
small pieces before we eat it. If we eat only a
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
small piece at a time we shall not eat too fast.
If we cut our food fine we can find any bones and
other hard things, and can keep them from getting
inside the body.</p>

<p><b>13. Chewing.</b>&mdash;Digestion goes on in the mouth.
The mouth does three things to food. <i>First</i>, it
mixes and grinds it between the teeth.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, it pours water over the food through
fine tubes. The water of the mouth is called the
saliva. The saliva makes the food a thin paste.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, the saliva changes some of the starch to
sugar. Starch must be all changed to sugar before
it can feed the cells.</p>

<p><b>14. Too fast eating.</b>&mdash;Some boys fill their mouths
with food. Then they cannot chew their food and
cannot mix saliva with it. They swallow their food
whole, and then their stomachs have to grind it.
The saliva cannot mix with the food and so it is
too dry in the stomach. Then their stomachs ache,
and they are sick. Eating too fast and too much
makes children sick oftener than anything else.</p>

<p>Birds swallow their food whole, for they have no
teeth. Instead, a strong gizzard inside grinds the
food. We have no gizzards, and so we must grind
our food with our teeth.</p>

<p><b>15. Teeth.</b>&mdash;We have two kinds of teeth. The
front teeth are sharp and cut the food; the back
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
teeth are flat and rough and grind it. If you bite
nuts or other hard things you may break off a little
piece of a tooth. Then the tooth may decay and
ache.</p>

<p>After you eat, some food will sometimes stick
to the teeth. Then it may decay and make your
breath smell bad. After each meal always pick the
teeth with a wooden toothpick. Your teeth will
also get dirty and become
stained unless you clean
them. Always brush your
teeth with water every
morning. This will also
keep them from decaying.</p>

<i>b</i> crop or bag for carrying food.<br />
<i>c</i> stomach.<br />
<i>d</i> intestine.<br />
<i>e</i> gizzard or food grinder.</p>
</div>

<p><b>16. Swallowing.</b>&mdash;When
food has been chewed and
mixed with saliva until it
is a paste, it is ready to be
swallowed. The tongue
pushes the food into a bag
just back of the mouth. We
call the bag the <i>pharynx</i>.
Then the pharynx squeezes it down a long tube
and into the stomach. The nose and windpipe
also open into this bag, but both are closed by
little doors while we swallow. We cannot breathe
while we swallow. If the doors are not shut
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
tightly, some food gets into the windpipe and
chokes us.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. We eat to feed the cells of the body.</p>
<p>2. All food must be made into blood.</p>
<p>3. Changing food to blood is digestion.</p>
<p>4. Cooking softens food and makes it taste good.</p>
<p>5. Food is ground fine in the mouth, and mixed
with saliva to form a paste. Some of its
starch is changed to sugar.</p>
<p>6. If food is only half chewed the stomach has to
grind it.</p>
<p>7. When we swallow, the tongue pushes the food
into a bag back of the mouth and the bag
squeezes it down a long tube to the stomach.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>DIGESTION IN THE STOMACH</h3>

<p><b>17. The stomach.</b>&mdash;When food is swallowed it
goes to the stomach. The stomach is a thin bag.
In a man it holds about three pints. Like the
mouth, it does three things to the food.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="i0017-illus" id="i0017-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0017-illus.jpg" width="150" height="195" alt="Stomach glands" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>Gastric glands in the stomach<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&#215;200).</b><br />
The cells <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, form the juice.<br />
The fibers <i>c</i>, bind the tubes in place.</p>
</div>

<p><i>First</i>, the stomach gently
stirs and mixes the food.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, it pours a fluid
over the food. This fluid
is called the <i>gastric juice</i>.
The gastric juice is sour
and bitter.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, the gastric juice
changes some of the albumin
of food to a liquid form.</p>

<p>If the mouth has done
its work well, the stomach
does its work easily and
we do not know it. But if the mouth has eaten
food too fast and has not chewed it well, then the
stomach must do the work of the mouth too. In
that case it gets tired and aches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
        <b>18. The intestine.</b>&mdash;The food stays in the stomach
only a little while. All the time a little keeps
trickling into a long coil of tube. This tube is
called the <i>intestine</i> or the <i>bowels</i>. Three or four
hours after a hearty meal the stomach is empty.
Some of the food has been changed to a liquid,
but most of it has only been ground to smaller
pieces, and mixed with a great deal of water.
Now it all must be changed to a liquid.</p>

<p><b>19. What the intestine does.</b>&mdash;Like the mouth
and stomach, the intestine does three things.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, it mixes the food and makes it pass down
the tube.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, two sets of cells behind the stomach
make two liquids and pour them into the intestine.
One set of cells is the <i>sweetbread</i>, or <i>pancreas</i>,
and its liquid is the <i>pancreatic juice</i>. The
other is the <i>liver</i> and its fluid is the <i>bile</i>.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, the pancreatic juice makes three changes
in food. <i>First</i>, like the mouth, it changes starch
to sugar. <i>Second</i>, like the stomach, it makes albumin
a liquid. <i>Third</i>, it divides fat into fine drops.
These drops then mix with water and do not float
on its top.</p>

<p><b>20. Bile.</b>&mdash;The bile is yellow and bitter. It
helps the pancreatic juice do its work. It also
helps to keep the inside of the intestine clean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
        <b>21. Digestion of water and minerals.</b>&mdash;Water and
the mineral parts of food do not need to be
changed at all, but can become part of the blood
just as they are. Seeds and husks and tough
strings of flesh all pass the length of the intestine
and are not changed.</p>

<p><b>22. How food gets into the blood.</b>&mdash;By the time
food is half way down the intestine it is mostly
liquid and ready to become part of the blood.
This liquid soaks through the sides of the intestine
and into the blood tubes. At last the food
reaches the end of the intestine. Most of its liquid
has then soaked into the blood tubes and only
some solid waste is left.</p>

<p><b>23. Work of the liver.</b>&mdash;The food is now in the
blood, but has not become a part of it. It is
carried to the liver. There the liver changes the
food to good blood, and then the blood hurries
on and feeds the cells of the body. Spoiled food
may be swallowed and taken into the blood with
the good food. The liver takes out the poisons
and sends them back again with the bile. The
liver keeps us from getting poisoned.</p>

<p><b>24. Bad food.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the stomach and intestine
cannot digest the food. They cannot digest
green apples, but they try hard to do so. They
stir the apples faster and faster until there is
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
a great pain. Sometimes the stomach throws up
the food and then the pain and sickness stop.
Spoiled food makes us sick in the same way.</p>

<p><b>25. Too fast eating.</b>&mdash;When the food stays too
long in the stomach or intestine it sours, or decays,
just as it does outside of the body. This makes
us very sick. When we eat too much, or when
we do not chew the food to small pieces, the
stomach may be a long time in digesting the
food. Then it may become sour and make us
sick.</p>

<p><b>26. Biliousness.</b>&mdash;When the food is poor or becomes
sour, it is poorly digested. Then the liver
has more work to do, and does not change the
food to blood as it should. It also lets some of the
sour poisons pass by it. These poison the whole
body and make the head ache. We call this <i>biliousness</i>.
The tongue is then covered with a white
or yellow coat and the mouth tastes bad. These
are signs of sickness. The stomach and liver are
out of order.</p>

<p><b>27. Rules for eating.</b>&mdash;If we eat as we should,
our stomach will digest its food. We must follow
three rules.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, we must chew the food in the mouth
until all the lumps are fine. Then the food will
be ready for the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
        <i>Second</i>, we must eat slowly. If we eat fast we
cannot chew the food well. The stomach cannot
take care of food if it comes too fast. We must
swallow all of one mouthful before we put another
into the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, we must eat only at meal times. The
stomach needs a rest. Even a little candy, or
apples, or nuts will keep the stomach at work,
and tire it out. A child needs to eat more often
than his father. So, besides his meals, he should
have something to eat in the middle of the morning
and some more in the afternoon. But he should
not be eating at all hours. He ought not to eat
little bits just before dinner, for that spoils his
meal.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The stomach and intestine stir and rub the
food, and mix it with juices.</p>
<p>2. The juices change albumin to a liquid, and
starch to sugar. They also change fat to
the form of tiny drops.</p>
<p>3. The digested food soaks through the sides of
the intestine into the blood tubes.</p>
<p>4. The blood carries the food to the liver.</p>
<p>5. The liver changes food to blood.</p>
<p>6. Blood goes to all parts of the body and feeds
the cells.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
        7. The liver keeps poisons from getting into the blood.</p>
<p>8. Water and minerals become a part of the blood
without being digested.</p>
<p>9. When food is not well digested, the liver cannot
make it into good blood. This makes us
bilious.</p>
<p>10. If food is not soon digested it sours and decays.
This makes us sick.</p>
<p>11. We can make food digest quickly by chewing
it well and eating slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>FOODS</h3>

<p><b>28. Kinds of food.</b>&mdash;The cells of the body need
water, albumin, fat, sugar, and minerals for food.
We sometimes eat sugar alone, and we drink pure
water. But most of our food is a mixture of all
five kinds of food. Food comes from animals and
plants.</p>

<p><b>29. Milk</b>.&mdash;Milk is the best food known. It
contains just enough water, albumin, fat, sugar, and
minerals. Babies and young mammals live on milk
alone. A man can live upon four quarts of milk a
day. In sickness, milk is the very best food for
men, as well as for babies.</p>

<p>The albumin of milk becomes hard when the
milk sours. This makes <i>cheese</i>. The fat of milk
rises to the top. We call it <i>cream</i>. When cream
is churned, the pure fat comes together in a lump.
Pure fat of milk is called <i>butter</i>. Cheese and butter
are both good foods.</p>

<p><b>30. Eggs.</b>&mdash;Eggs are also good food. The white
of an egg is almost pure albumin. The yolk is
albumin and fat. Eggs have no starch or sugar.
         <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
They are not a perfect food, for some sugar must
be eaten. But they can be quickly digested and
they produce a great deal of strength.</p>

<p><b>31. Meat.</b>&mdash;Meat contains albumin and fat, but
no sugar. Fish, oysters, and clams are like meat.
They all make good food. Boys and girls should
eat milk, eggs, and meat. These foods are the best
to give strength to the body. Nearly all food from
animals is more quickly digested and gives more
strength than food from plants.</p>

<p><b>32. Bread.</b>&mdash;White bread is a food made from
wheat. The wheat is ground to flour. Flour is
mixed with water, and yeast is added. The yeast
makes a gas, and the gas puffs up the wet flour
and makes it full of holes. The holes make the
bread <i>light</i>. Then bread is baked. Rye or corn
meal makes good bread. Cake, biscuit, and pancakes
are much like bread. Sometimes in place of
yeast, baking powder is used to make the bread or
cake light.</p>

<p><b>33. Meal.</b>&mdash;Oatmeal, corn meal, and cracked
wheat and rice are sometimes boiled, and eaten
with milk. Bread, biscuit, oatmeal, and corn meal
are made from grain. All are very much alike.
The cooking makes them look and taste different,
but yet they are nearly the same.</p>

<p><b>34. Why we need grain food.</b>&mdash;All kinds of grain
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
have much albumin, but only a little fat. But all
have a great deal of starch. By digestion the starch
becomes sugar. Grain is a good food because it
has starch or sugar. Animal foods have no sugar,
so we eat grain food with them. The two together
make the most nourishing food. Potatoes have a
great deal of starch and only a little albumin.
They also are good food with meat.</p>

<p class="caption2"><b>A healthy man needs as much food as this every day.</b></p>
</div>

<p>A person cannot live well upon plant food alone,
for it has too much starch and sugar, and too little
albumin and fat. We need nearly equal parts of
albumin, fat, and sugar. A mixture of bread, meat,
eggs, vegetables, and milk makes the best food.</p>

<p><b>35. Fruit.</b>&mdash;Fruit, like apples, peaches, and plums
all have sugar. They taste good, and give us an
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
appetite for other kinds of food. They have little
albumin or fat.</p>

<p><b>36. Salt.</b>&mdash;There is enough mineral matter in all
food, and we do not have to eat iron or lime or soda.
But we do need some more salt. Even animals
need salt. Salt makes food taste good, and helps
its digestion.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0026-illus" id="i0026-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0026-illus.jpg" width="500" height="427" alt="Unhealthy well" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"><b>People are made sick by drinking water from such a well.</b></p>
</div>

<p><b>37. Water.</b>&mdash;Water is also a food, for it forms
the most of our bodies. All food has water. Even
dry crackers contain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
        <b>38. Pure water.</b>&mdash;Water in a well runs through
the dirty earth, and yet is clear and pure. This is
because sand holds back the dirt. But sometimes
slops from the house, and water from the barn yard,
soak through the soil until the sand is full. Then
the well water will be dirty and poisonous. People
are often made sick by drinking such water. In
cities the dirt fills all the soil and spoils the water.
So the water must be brought from the country in
large pipes.</p>

<p>Water in lead pipes takes up some of the lead.
Lead is a poison. You should let the water run off
from a pipe a little while before you use it. Good
water is clear and has no smell or taste. Dirty or
yellow water, or water with a taste or smell, is not
fit for use.</p>

<p><b>39. Tea and coffee.</b>&mdash;Tea and coffee are steeped in
water and used as a drink. The drink is the water.
The tea and coffee are neither food nor drink.
They cause the cells of the body to do more work,
and at the same time they take away the feeling
of being tired. They do not give strength to the
body, but are like a whip and make the body work
harder.</p>

<p><b>40. The appetite.</b>&mdash;When we have so many kinds
of food, what kind is best for us? The taste of
food tells us the kind of food to eat. Bread and
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
meat, and such plain foods, always taste good, and
we never get tired of them. Sugar tastes good
until we get enough. Any more makes us sick.
More than enough sugar or starch is found in
bread and potatoes.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0028-illus" id="i0028-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0028-illus.jpg" width="500" height="429" alt="Intemperance" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"><b>One kind of intemperance.</b></p>
</div>

<p>If we can eat food day after day, without getting
tired of it, the food is good for us. If we get
tired of its taste, either the food is not good for
us or we are eating too much. Bad tasting or
bad smelling food is always dangerous.
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>We can tell how much food to eat by our <i>hunger</i>
or <i>appetite</i>. We can always feel when we have
enough. Then is the time to stop.</p>

<p>Sometimes we eat plain bread and meat until we
have enough, and then sweet cake or pie is brought
in. Then we have a false appetite for sweet things.
If the sweet things had not made a false hunger, we
should have had enough to eat. But the false appetite
makes us want more, and so we eat too much,
and sometimes get sick from it.</p>

<p><b>41. Intemperance.</b>&mdash;Eating for the sake of a false
appetite is <i>intemperance</i>. Drinking strong drink
for the sake of its taste is a common form of intemperance.
But eating too much preserves, pie, and
candy is intemperance too, and can do a great deal
of harm. A little pie, or pudding, or candy, is good,
because we can eat our sugar as well that way as in
bread. But we should eat only a little.</p>

<p><b>42. Food and Diseases.</b>&mdash;If our food is dirty or is
handled with dirty hands, or is put into dirty dishes,
there may be disease germs in it. Our food should
always be clean, and we should have our hands clean
when we handle it or eat it.</p>

<p>Storekeepers sometimes keep fruit and vegetables
out of doors where street dust may blow upon it.
This dust is often full of disease germs. Flies may
also bring disease germs to the food. If food is
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
kept where dust and flies can get at it, we ought not
to buy it.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Food is a mixture of water, albumin, fat, starch
or sugar, and minerals.</p>
<p>2. Animal foods, like milk, eggs, and meat, have
albumin and fat in the best form.</p>
<p>3. Plant food has albumin and fat, but it has
very much starch or sugar. So, taken together
with animal food, it makes a complete
food.</p>
<p>4. Lime, iron, soda, and salt are found in all foods,
but we must add a little more salt to food.</p>
<p>5. Water is found in all food, but we must drink
some besides.</p>
<p>6. Dirty water, or water with a taste or smell, is
not fit for use.</p>
<p>7. Taste tells us what kind of food to use.</p>
<p>8. Hunger, or the appetite, tells us how much food
to use.</p>
<p>9. There can be a false hunger for sweet things.
This may lead us to eat too much.</p>
<p>10. Eating too much of sweet things is one form
of intemperance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>TOBACCO</h3>

<p><b>43. Harmful eating.</b>&mdash;Men often eat for the fun
of eating, and sometimes they eat harmful things.
They chew tobacco and drink strong drinks, because
they like their taste, just as a child eats
candy.</p>

<p><b>44. Tobacco.</b>&mdash;Men have always drunk strong
drink. Within the last four hundred years, men
have learned another way to please a wrong taste.
When Columbus discovered America, the Indians
were using tobacco. They taught the Spaniards
how to smoke it, and since then almost the whole
world has used it.</p>

<p>Tobacco is the leaf of a tall plant. It needs a
better soil than any other crop. It takes the richness
from the ground, and spoils it for other crops.</p>

<p><b>45. Nicotine.</b>&mdash;About 1/30 of each tobacco leaf is
a strong poison. This poison is called <i>nicotine</i>.
A drop or two of it, or as much of it as is in a
strong cigar, will kill a man. It gives the tobacco
its smell and taste. Men use tobacco for the sake
of a poison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
        <b>46. Why men use tobacco.</b>&mdash;Men give queer reasons
for using tobacco. One smokes for its company,
another because he is with company. One
smokes to make his brain think better, and another
to keep himself from thinking. Some use tobacco
to help digest their food, and others use it to keep
themselves from eating so much. Boys smoke to
make themselves look like men. The real reason
for using tobacco is that men learn to like its taste,
and do not care if it harms them.</p>

<p><b>47. Spitting.</b>&mdash;Tobacco in any form makes the
saliva flow. Men do not dare swallow it, for it
makes them sick. So they spit it out. No one
likes to see this. It is a dirty and filthy habit.
Besides, the saliva is lost, and cannot help digest
food.</p>

<p>Tobacco stains the teeth brown. You can always
tell a tobacco chewer by his teeth. His breath will
smell of tobacco, and even his clothes are offensive
to the nose.</p>

<p><b>48. Tobacco lessens strength.</b>&mdash;Tobacco always
makes a person sick at the stomach, at first. After
a while, he becomes used to it, and an ordinary
chew or smoke does not make him sick. But a
large chew or smoke will always make him sick
again. When a person is sick from tobacco he
is very weak. Even if he is not sick, the tobacco
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
poisons his muscles and makes his strength less.
When a man trains for a hard race he never uses
tobacco.</p>

<p><b>49. Tobacco hinders digestion.</b>&mdash;Tobacco and its
smoke both have a burning taste. This makes the
throat sore, and causes a cough. Tobacco does
not help the stomach to digest food. Smokers and
chewers often have headaches and coated tongues.
These are signs of a poor digestion.</p>

<p><b>50. Effect upon the young.</b>&mdash;Tobacco is more
harmful to boys than to men. If boys smoke they
cannot run fast or long. They cannot work hard
with their brains or hands. They do not grow
fast, and are liable to have weak hearts.</p>

<p><b>51. Tobacco harms others.</b>&mdash;Many persons do not
like the smell of tobacco, and no one likes the spit.
No one should use it in the presence of others.
The tobacco user's pleasure should not spoil the
comfort and happiness of others.</p>

<p><b>52. Snuff.</b>&mdash;Powdered tobacco is called snuff.
Snuff causes sneezing. No one should harm the
nose and the whole body for the pleasure of a
sneeze. Years ago snuff was used much more than
it is now.</p>

<p><b>53. Chewing.</b>&mdash;Chewing tobacco is the most
poisonous way of using it, for it keeps most of
the nicotine in the mouth. Chewing will make
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
any one very sick, unless he spits out all the
saliva.</p>

<p><b>54. Smoking.</b>&mdash;Men smoke pipes, cigars, and
cigarettes. The smoke has nicotine, and is poisonous.
Pipe stems get dirty and full of nicotine.
After a while they smell bad and are very poisonous.
An old smoker's pipe will make a young
smoker sick.</p>

<p><b>55. Cigarettes.</b>&mdash;Cigars are not so poisonous as
a pipe, for more of the nicotine is burned up.
Cigarettes are often made of weak tobacco. A
cigarette does not contain so much tobacco as a
cigar. Hence a cigarette does not cost much. It
can be smoked in a hurry. It does not make a boy
so sick as cigars do. Boys and men use a great
many cigarettes where they would not touch a cigar.
This makes the use of cigarettes the most dangerous
form of smoking. Selling cigarettes to young
boys is forbidden by law.</p>

<p><b>56. Habit.</b>&mdash;When men have used tobacco for
some time, they like it and feel bad without it.
So they get into the habit of using it, and find it
hard to stop. The tobacco seems to help them,
but it does not do so. It cheats men, and they
do not know it.</p>

<p><b>57. Chewing gum.</b>&mdash;Chewing gum is made from
pitch or paraffin, for these substances will not dissolve
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
in the mouth. The gum is flavored with
sugar and spices. The gum and its flavors are
not harmful in themselves, and yet chewing them
is harmful. Chewing makes a great deal of saliva
flow. All this saliva is wasted, and when we eat
our meals we may have too little. Then our food
will not digest well, but we shall have dyspepsia
and headaches.</p>

<p>By pulling and handling the gum while chewing
it, you may get some poisonous dirt into your
mouth, and make yourself very sick.</p>

<p>Even if your gum should not harm you, there is
a good reason for letting it alone. When you are
chewing gum, you look as if you were chewing
tobacco. No one likes to see a boy or girl even
appearing to chew tobacco. If you form a habit
of chewing gum you will be more likely to chew
tobacco when you are grown.</p>

<p><b>58. Souring of fruit.</b>&mdash;When a little fruit is set
away in a warm place for a day or two it sours or
ferments. Anything sweet will do the same thing.
Little bubbles rise up through the juice and a foam
comes on top. Then the juice
has a sharp taste or is sour.
Canned and preserved fruit becomes
sour soon after the jar
is opened, and cider soon turns
to vinegar. All fruit juice does
this even in cold weather. But
in cold weather it keeps for a
longer time.</p>

</div>

<p><b>59. Preserving fruit.</b>&mdash;If your
mother wishes to keep fruit all winter she boils it
and at once puts it into tight jars. This shuts
out the air and then the fruit keeps good all winter.
Boiling kills all living things, and no more can get
in through the tight jars. Does a living thing
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
have anything to do with making the fruit juice
turn sour?</p>

<p><b>60. Yeast.</b>&mdash;Yeast will make all sweet things ferment.
Bakers make yeast grow in bread sponge.
Yeast is alive. It is made of millions
of tiny round cells. New
cells sprout out from the side
of the old cells like young lilies
on an old lily bulb. Soon each
new cell breaks off and lives all
by itself. In a single night
enough new cells will form to fill
the whole loaf of bread.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>Yeast plant cells (&#215;500).</b></p>
</div>

<p><b>61. How yeast makes alcohol.</b>&mdash;Yeast
will grow only where sugar
is. When it has grown for some
time there is no more sugar, and instead of a sweet
taste there is a sharp or sour taste. The yeast has
changed the sugar to alcohol. All alcohol is made
from sugar by yeast.</p>

<p>The seeds of the yeast plant are everywhere in
the air. Some are on the skins of fruit and so are
found in the juice when it is squeezed out. There
they begin to grow at once and soon change the
sugar to alcohol. They do this by taking a gas
away from the sugar. The gas rises in little bubbles,
and makes a froth upon the top of the juice.
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Boiling kills the yeast plant. If the juice is at
once put into tight jars no new yeast plants can
get in, and so the juice keeps.</p>

<p><b>62. Vinegar.</b>&mdash;Sometimes fruit juice turns sour.
The sourness is due to vinegar. Besides yeast,
other little living plants fall into the juice and turn
the sugar to vinegar. But if there is much alcohol
in the juice, the vinegar plants will not grow.</p>

<p><b>63. Yeast in bread.</b>&mdash;Growing yeast plants always
make alcohol. They change some of the sugar of
bread dough to alcohol and a gas. The gas bubbles
through the bread and makes it light. When bread
is baked, the heat of the oven drives off the alcohol,
and so we do not eat any in bread.</p>

<p><b>64. Alcohol.</b>&mdash;Alcohol is a clear liquid and looks
like water. It has a sharp taste and smell. It
burns very easily and makes a very hot flame. Its
smoke cannot be seen, and its flame will not make
anything black, as a match flame will do.</p>

<p><b>65. Use of alcohol.</b>&mdash;Alcohol will dissolve more
things than water will dissolve. It is used to dissolve
drugs, varnishes, perfumery, and many other
things. It will dissolve even oil and fat. Tailors
clean grease spots from clothes with it. It takes
water away from flesh and makes it dry, hard, and
tough. It will keep anything from rotting. In
museums we pour alcohol over pieces of flesh or
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
plants in glass jars. Then they will keep and we
can look at them at any time. Thus alcohol is a
very useful thing, and we could hardly do without it.</p>

<p><b>66. Strong drink.</b>&mdash;Some men use alcohol in a
wrong way. They swallow it as a drink. But
men cannot drink pure alcohol, for it would burn
their mouths. They always drink it mixed with
some water. Alcohol in water is called <i>strong
drink</i>.</p>

<p><b>67. Why men use strong drink.</b>&mdash;Some men take
strong drink to make themselves warm, and some
to make themselves cool. Some drink to keep
themselves awake, and some to make themselves
sleep. Some drink to keep themselves still, and
some to make themselves stir around faster. Men
use strong drink really because it seems to make
them feel strong for a while. It does not make
them stronger, but it harms the body and the mind.
Its alcohol does the harm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>KINDS OF STRONG DRINK</h3>

<p><b>68. Wine.</b>&mdash;All strong drink is alcohol and
water. There may be other things to give it taste,
but alcohol and water are always in it. No strong
drink is over one half alcohol.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="i0042-illus" id="i0042-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0042-illus.jpg" width="150" height="229" alt="Wine" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>A glass of wine contains so,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much alcohol.</b></p>
</div>

<p>In olden times wine was the only strong drink.
Men used to crush out the juice of grapes and let
it ferment. This made wine. But
very often they used the juice before it
fermented. Then it had no alcohol and
could do no harm, but was a good food.
We read of wine in the Bible. Some
of it was fresh fruit juice.</p>

<p>In wine, the sugar is changed to
alcohol. The rest of the juice stays
the same. All wine is made by the yeast plant
growing in fruit juice. No yeast is put in, for
there is always enough on the outside of the fruit.
Wine is about one tenth alcohol.</p>

<p><b>69. Homemade wine.</b>&mdash;Cider is a kind of wine.
It is made from apple juice. It has alcohol a day
or two after it is made. All homemade wines have
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
alcohol. Any of them can make a person drunk.
Using weak homemade wine and cider often makes
an appetite for stronger drinks. The alcohol in any
of them is enough to harm the body.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="i0043-illus" id="i0043-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0043-illus.jpg" width="150" height="223" alt="Beer" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>A glass of beer contains so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much alcohol.</b></p>
</div>

<p><b>70. Beer.</b>&mdash;After man had made wine for a long
time, some one found out how to cultivate yeast.
Then men could make sugar and water
ferment whenever they wanted to. So
men boiled grain to take out its sugar.
Then they poured off the liquor and
added yeast and let it ferment. This
made beer and ale. Now millions of
bushels of grain are used every year
in making beer. Men call beer a <i>light</i>
drink. But it has alcohol and is a strong drink,
and can make men drunk.</p>

<p><b>71. Root beer.</b>&mdash;Some persons boil roots and
herbs, and add molasses and yeast. Then the
liquid ferments and becomes <i>root beer</i>. They say
"it has no alcohol, for we made it." But it does
have alcohol, for yeast always makes alcohol. Some
ginger ale is made by putting yeast in sweetened
ginger water. It has alcohol, too.</p>

<p><b>72. Distillation.</b>&mdash;Boiling water turns to vapor
or steam and goes off in the air. When the vapor
is cooled, you can see the water again. It often
cools on the window and makes little streams of
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
water. You can catch the steam in a tube. If
you keep the tube cool, the steam will turn to water
in the tube. This process is called <i>distillation</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="i0044-illus" id="i0044-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0044-illus.jpg" width="150" height="221" alt="Whisky" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>A glass of whisky contains so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much alcohol.</b></p>
</div>

<p>Boiling alcohol also passes off into the air as
vapor. When the vapor is cooled, it becomes liquid
again. Alcohol boils with less heat
than water. When alcohol in water
is heated, the alcohol boils first. So
the vapor has more alcohol than the
water. When the vapor is cooled, the
liquid has more alcohol than it had at
first. When the liquid is distilled again
it has more alcohol yet. Pure alcohol
can be made in this way.</p>

<p><b>73. Whisky.</b>&mdash;Distilling wine or strong beer
makes <i>whisky</i> and <i>brandy</i>. Whisky is one half
alcohol. It is more harmful than wine or beer.</p>

<p><b>74. Habit.</b>&mdash;Some strong drinks have only a
little alcohol and some have a great deal. No one
begins to drink the strong liquors. He begins with
wine or beer. When he has once learned, he has
a hard time to stop drinking. It is dangerous to
drink even weak drinks.</p>

<p><b>75. Strong drink and thirst.</b>&mdash;When a man is
thirsty, water will satisfy him but strong drink will
not. Sometimes the mouth is dry and dirty and
then a man feels thirsty. Rinsing the mouth
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
with water, and rubbing the tongue and teeth
clean will help the dryness and stop the thirst.
At any rate, strong drink will only make the
mouth dryer.</p>

<p>Some men drink only when they are tired. Then
a cup of strong and hot tea or coffee will make
them feel much better than a glass of strong drink,
and will not harm them so much.</p>

<p>When strong drink is swallowed, its alcohol takes
water from the mouth. When your mouth is dry,
you feel thirsty. Strong drink makes the mouth
dry, and so a drink makes a man more thirsty.
The alcohol also makes the mouth smart. Men
need another drink to cool the mouth after the first
one. So one drink leads to another. All the while
a person drinks water with the alcohol until he has
too much water. But his mouth is dry and he feels
as thirsty as ever.</p>

<p><b>76. Effect of alcohol upon the stomach.</b>&mdash;When
strong drink is swallowed it makes the stomach
smart just as it does the mouth. So the stomach
feels warm, but it is really no warmer. This harms
the stomach and keeps it from working well.</p>

<p>Alcohol also keeps the gastric juice from changing
albumin to a liquid. Alcohol keeps flesh from
decaying in a museum. In the same way it may
hinder the digestion of food in the stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
        When alcohol is used for only a short time, the
stomach can get well; but if it is used for months
and years, the stomach will stay weak. Then the
drinker can hardly eat at all.</p>

<p><b>77. What becomes of alcohol.</b>&mdash;In the stomach
a great deal of gastric juice is mixed with the
alcohol. So it is very weak when it reaches the
intestine. Alcohol needs only a little digesting.
It soon soaks into the blood from the intestine
along with the other food. The blood flows fast
and washes the alcohol away as soon as it leaves
the intestine. Too little gets into the blood at once
to harm it much.</p>

<p>Alcohol goes to the liver, and is there destroyed;
but it still does great harm. The liver has to
attend to the alcohol, and so it does not change
the food to good blood, and it does not take all the
poisons out of the blood. Then the whole body
becomes weak and sick. Alcohol hurts the liver
first, and more than other parts of the body. On
this account, drinkers often have bilious attacks
and stomach troubles.</p>

<p><b>78. Bitters.</b>&mdash;Many medicines are made by dissolving
drugs in alcohol. In taking a strong medicine,
we use only a few drops, and so do not get
much alcohol. Some kinds of medicines must be
taken in large doses. Bitters are weak medicines,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and must be taken by the tablespoonful. A tablespoonful
of the medicine has more alcohol than a
large drink of whisky. The bitters seem to make
a person feel well, but it is because he is taking
a large amount of strong drink.</p>

<p>Jamaica Ginger is only common ginger dissolved
in alcohol. It, too, is a form of strong drink.</p>

<p><b>79. Strong drink as medicine.</b>&mdash;People sometimes
keep whisky or brandy in the house to give for
colds or other slight forms of sickness. A drink of
hot coffee does more good than the strong drink,
and has none of its dangers.</p>

<p>By using whisky or brandy for medicine, children
learn to believe in strong drink, and so they
will be likely to use it when they grow up. This
reason alone ought to keep any one from giving it
to a child.</p>

<p><b>80. Alcohol in cooking.</b>&mdash;In making bread, alcohol
is formed in the dough by the yeast. When the
bread is baked, all the alcohol is driven off by
the heat, and so we do not eat any.</p>

<p>Sometimes brandy or wine is put into desserts.
If it is put in after the dessert is cooked, we shall
get as much alcohol as if we had drunk it. If the
liquor is put in before cooking, the heat will drive
off the alcohol but the flavor of the liquor will
remain. The flavor will do no harm in itself, but
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
people will learn its taste, and from it may learn to
like the strong drink itself. The alcohol in bread
has no special flavor and does not leave any taste
behind. So we cannot learn to like strong drink
by eating bread.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE BLOOD</h3>

<p><b>81. Blood.</b>&mdash;After food becomes blood, it goes
to every part of the body to feed the cells. Even
a pin prick anywhere in the body draws blood.
The blood makes the skin pink.
There are five or six quarts of blood
in a man's body. This is about 1/13
of his body.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 200px;">

<p class="caption"><b>Blood corpuscles (&#215;400).</b><br />
<i>a</i> a pile of red blood cells.<br />
<i>b</i> red blood cells seen flatwise.<br />
<i>c</i> red blood cells seen edgewise.<br />
<i>d</i> white blood cells.</p>
</div>

<p>Blood looks like a red liquid.
But if you look at it through a
strong microscope, it looks like
water, and millions of little red cells.
These cells carry air through the
body. They make the blood look red.
There are also a smaller number of white cells.
Blood is made of red cells, white cells, and a liquid.</p>

<p><b>82. The liquid in blood.</b>&mdash;The liquid part of the
blood is albumin, and water, with a little fat, sugar,
and minerals. It is food and drink for the cells of
the body. When blood is drawn from the body
it soon becomes like jelly. We call the jelly a
<i>clot</i>. When you cut your finger, a clot forms in
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the cut and plugs up the bleeding place. If it
did not, the blood would all run out of the body
and we should die.</p>

<i>f</i> valve to keep blood from returning to the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ventricle.</p>
</div>

<p><b>83. The heart.</b>&mdash;The blood is held in tubes. A
pump inside the body keeps it always moving.
This pump is called the <i>heart</i>. The heart is
a bag of muscle with
thick sides. It is about
as large as your fist.
When it is full, it has
the power to make itself
smaller, and so it
squeezes the blood out
through a tube. We
can feel each squeeze
as a heart-beat. You
can find the heart-beat
just to the left of the
middle of the body
about two hand-breadths
below the
neck.</p>

<p><b>84. The heart-beat.</b>&mdash;A man's heart beats about
seventy times each minute. Boys' and girls' hearts
beat much faster. Running or hard work of any
kind makes the heart beat faster yet. Your heart
will keep on beating until you die. It does not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
seem to rest at all, yet it works only while you
feel it beat. Between each beat it rests while the
blood is filling it again. So it really rests one half
of the time.</p>

<p><b>85. Arteries.</b>&mdash;The heart pumps the blood
through a single tube. This tube opens into
smaller tubes. These open into still smaller ones.
You must use a strong microscope to see the
finest blood tubes. The tubes reach every part
of the body, and carry blood to its cells. They
are called <i>arteries</i>. At each heart-beat a wave
of blood can be felt
in an artery. This
wave is the <i>pulse</i>. It
can be felt in the
wrist, temples, and
other places. By the
pulse we can tell how
often and how strongly
the heart is beating.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="i0051-illus" id="i0051-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0051-illus.jpg" width="150" height="131" alt="Capillaries" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>Arrangement of capillaries.</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a</i> smallest artery.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b</i> smallest vein.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>c</i> network of capillaries.</p>
</div>

<p><b>86. Capillaries.</b>&mdash;The
smallest arteries
divide into a fine network
of small tubes. These tubes are the <i>capillaries</i>.
They lie around every cell of the body.
Their sides are very thin. As the blood flows
through them, some of it soaks through the sides
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of the tubes. Blood contains all kinds of food
for the cells. Each cell is always wet with food
and can eat it at any time. The cells are like
the tiny animal, the ameba, and can take in the
food by any part of their bodies. The cells are
better off than the ameba, for their food is brought
to them. They pay the body for their food by
working for it.</p>

<p><b>87. Veins.</b>&mdash;The capillaries come together again
to form large tubes. These tubes are called <i>veins</i>.
Only a little of the blood goes through the sides of
a capillary. The rest flows on into the veins. The
veins unite to form two large tubes. These two
tubes open into the heart.</p>

<p><b>88. How the blood flows.</b>&mdash;The blood is pumped
out of the heart, through the arteries to the capillaries.
There some goes out to the cells. The rest
flows into the veins and goes back to the heart.
All the blood in the body passes through the heart
every two minutes. It takes only twenty seconds
for a drop of blood to go from the heart to the toes
and back again. The arteries are deep in the flesh,
but some of the large veins can be seen upon the
back of the hands.</p>

<p><b>89. Bleeding.</b>&mdash;If a large artery or vein is cut
there is a great deal of bleeding. You can always
stop a cut from bleeding by holding it fast between
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the hands. Do not be afraid of the blood when
you see any one bleeding, but hold the sides of the
cut tightly with both of your hands. This will stop
any bleeding until help comes. You may keep a
person from bleeding to death by doing this when
other persons are afraid of the blood.</p>

<p><b>90. Healing cuts.</b>&mdash;When your flesh is cut it
soon grows together again. The work of the little
white cells in the blood is to help heal cuts and
wounds and bruises. These cells are like little
amebas in the blood. They keep moving around
with the blood, and now and then burrow outside
the capillaries to see if all is well. If they find a
cut, hundreds and thousands rush to the spot at
once. Some eat up any specks of dirt on the cut.
Others fit themselves into the sides of the cut and
grow long and slender, like strings, and so bind the
two edges of the cut together. In this way all cuts
are healed.</p>

<p><b>91. The white blood cells kill disease germs.</b>&mdash;There
are tiny living beings everywhere in the air,
and soil, and water. Some of them can grow inside
a man and make him sick. These tiny things are
called <i>disease germs</i>. One kind gives a man
typhoid fever, and another diphtheria. Another
kind grows on cuts, and sometimes makes them
very sore. The white cells of the blood are always
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
watching for these enemies, like a cat hunting mice,
and when they find them they at once try to kill
them. But sometimes
the white blood cells
get killed. Then they
look like cream in the
cut. We call this
creamy liquid <i>matter</i>
or <i>pus</i>, and say "We
have caught cold in the
cut." In most pricks
and cuts the white
cells of the blood can
kill all these enemies
and also heal the cut.</p>

<p><b>92. Catching cold.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the cold air blows
on our head and hurts the cells of the nose. If
there are disease germs in the air, they may grow in
the injured part of the nose and make us have a
"cold in the head." Then the white blood cells
gather at the spot so as to kill the disease germs.
Also the arteries bring a great deal of blood to the
nose so as to heal the injured parts. Some of the
white blood cells and the liquid from the blood run
out, and we have to blow the nose. The white
blood cells help to make us well whenever we catch
a cold or other kind of sickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
        <b>93. Red blood cells.</b>&mdash;The red blood cells are like
tiny flat plates. They float in the liquid part of the
blood and make the blood look red. They carry
air from the lungs to the cells of every part of the
body, and thus help all the cells to breathe.</p>

<p><b>94. Why the heart beats hard when we run.</b>&mdash;When
we work hard, the cells of our bodies need
a great deal of food. So the heart beats much
harder, and sends them much more blood. We can
feel our heart beat when we run hard.</p>

<p>When the cells work they get more blood in
another way. The arteries become larger and hold
more blood. Then the part looks red and feels
warm. Thus your face gets red when you run
hard. This is because your heart and arteries
bring more blood to feed the working cells.</p>

<p><b>95. Need of a strong heart.</b>&mdash;The heart must
keep sending blood to feed the cells. If it should
stop for only a little while, the cells would starve to
death and we should die. We need strong hearts.
When we work very hard for a long time, the heart
gets tired. Then the cells do not get enough food
and we feel weak all over. Boys ought not to run
and lift till they are tired out, for this hurts their
hearts.</p>

<p><b>96. What alcohol does to the blood.</b>&mdash;Alcohol
hinders the digestion of food. Then too little food
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
will reach the blood, and so the cells of the body
will get too little. Alcohol does not add strength
to the body, but it takes it away. It seems to
make men stronger, for it takes away their tired
feelings. But it makes them really weaker, for it
harms the blood.</p>

<p><b>97. How alcohol affects the heart.</b>&mdash;Alcohol at
first makes the heart beat more strongly and
quickly, but it tires it out and makes it weaker.
Then the heart pumps too little blood to the rest
of the body, and a man is weaker all over.</p>

<p>If a drinker tries to run or work hard, his heart
may not pump enough food to the working cells
of his arms and legs. Strong drink takes away a
man's strength and makes him less able to endure
a long strain.</p>

<p><b>98. How alcohol harms the arteries.</b>&mdash;Alcohol
causes the arteries to become larger and to carry
more blood. Then the face will be red and the
skin will become warm. This makes a person feel
well, and he seems to be helped. His blood seems
to be flowing faster because his face is red. But
really it is flowing slower.</p>

<p>When the arteries have been made large very
often, they stay large all the time. A drinker's
nose is often red from this cause.</p>

<p>Alcohol sometimes causes the arteries to become
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
hard, and even to change to a kind of bone. Then
they cannot change their size to carry just so much
blood as each part needs.</p>

<p><b>99. How tobacco affects the heart.</b>&mdash;Tobacco weakens
all the body, but it harms the heart more than
the rest. It often makes the heart beat slowly at
one time and fast at another. It weakens the heart
and keeps it from working harder when the working
cells need more food. A smoker gets out of
breath quickly. He cannot run far or work very
hard. Chewing is a still more harmful form of
using tobacco. When men train for a game or a
race they never use tobacco.</p>

<p>Boys are not so strong as men, and so tobacco is
more hurtful to them. Boys are harmed by tobacco
far more than men. Cigarette smoke harms their
stomachs and keeps food from their blood. If boys
smoke, they become pale and weak. The poisonous
smoke weakens the heart, and they cannot run
or work so hard as they should. Even if a father
uses tobacco, he should not allow his boys to use it.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Blood is a liquid. It contains many round red
cells and a few white cells.</p>
<p>2. Blood contains all kinds of food for the cells
of the body.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
        3. The blood is kept moving by the heart.</p>
<p>4. The heart pumps or beats about seventy times
a minute.</p>
<p>5. The blood flows through arteries to all parts
of the body.</p>
<p>6. The arteries open into the capillaries. Capillaries
make a network around each cell of
the body.</p>
<p>7. Some of the liquid parts of the blood go out
through the sides of the capillaries and
become food for the cells of the body.</p>
<p>8. From the capillaries the blood flows into the
veins and back to the heart.</p>
<p>9. Bleeding can be stopped by holding the cut
tightly between the hands.</p>
<p>10. The white blood cells grow into the sides of
cuts, and so heal them. They also guard
the body against the seeds of many diseases.</p>
<p>11. The red blood cells carry air to the cells of the
body.</p>
<p>12. Alcohol weakens the heart and arteries.</p>
<p>13. Tobacco harms the heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>BREATHING, HEAT, AND CLOTHING</h3>

<p><b>100. The lungs.</b>&mdash;Our food becomes blood and
feeds the cells of our body, but we grow only a
little heavier. What
becomes of the
food?</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 225px;">

<i>a</i> larynx or voice box.<br />
<i>b</i> trachea or windpipe.<br />
<i>d</i> air sacs, each like a tiny frog's lung.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides food, air
is always getting into
our bodies. In
breathing, air passes
through the nose
into a tube in the
neck. This tube is
called the <i>windpipe</i>.
You can feel it as a
pile of hard rings in
the front part of the
neck. The windpipe
divides into many
branches. At the
end of its smallest
branches are little
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
bags or sacs. The branches and the sacs make
the two lungs. So a lung is a soft and spongy
piece of flesh, and can be blown
up like a rubber bag. A frog's
lung is a single, thin bag, about
half an inch across it. Each little
sac of a man's lung is like a tiny
frog's lung.</p>

<p class="caption"><b>A frog's lung (&#215;4).</b></p>
</div>

<p><b>101. The diaphragm.</b>&mdash;The lungs
fill the upper part of the body just
below the neck. They are covered
by the bony ribs, and rest
upon a broad muscle. This muscle
is called the <i>diaphragm</i>. It divides
the inside of the body into
two parts. The upper part
is the <i>chest</i>, and holds the
heart and lungs. The lower
part is the <i>abdomen</i>, and
holds the stomach, intestine,
and liver, and a few other
parts.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 225px;">
<a name="i0060b-illus" id="i0060b-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0060b-illus.jpg" width="150" height="189" alt="Internal parts" title=""/>
<p class="caption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The parts inside the body.</b></p>
<table class="toc" summary="2-Column Caption">
<tr><td class="c11"><i>a</i> lungs.</td><td class="c33"><i>d</i> stomach.</td></tr>

</table>
</div>

<p><b>102. Breathing.</b>&mdash;When
the diaphragm lowers itself,
or the ribs are raised, the
chest is made larger. Then
the air rushes through the
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
nose and swells out the lungs to the size of the chest.
This is taking a breath. Then the chest becomes
smaller again, and blows the air out. A man
breathes about eighteen times a minute. He does
not seem to rest in breathing, but as he works only
when he takes in breath, he rests one half of the
time.</p>

<p><b>103. How air gets into the blood.</b>&mdash;After the
blood has been around the body through the arteries
and capillaries and veins, the heart sends
every drop to the lungs before it sends it out to
feed the cells again. The blood flows through
little capillaries upon the sides of the air sacs.
There the red blood cells take up some of the
air, and carry it with them. When they have a
load of air, they become of a brighter red color.
The blood in the arteries on its way to the cells
is bright red.</p>

<p><b>104. How the cells get air.</b>&mdash;When the blood
reaches the capillaries around the cells of the body,
the red blood cells give up some of the air to the
cells. Thus each cell of the body gets some air,
and so it breathes. The cells cannot reach the
air themselves, and so the red blood cells bring it
to them. We breathe so as to supply the cells
with air.</p>

<p><b>105. What burning is.</b>&mdash;When meat is put into a
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
hot stove it quickly burns, and passes off in smoke,
and leaves only a little ashes. The ashes are the
mineral parts of the meat. If the fire is very hot,
you cannot see the smoke. The burning of the
meat makes heat. Heat in a steam engine makes
the machine do work.</p>

<p>Every fire must have plenty of air. If air is shut
off, the fire goes out. When meat burns, the air
unites with the meat and makes smoke, and ashes,
and gives out heat. Air unites with something in
every fire.</p>

<p><b>106. Burning inside the body.</b>&mdash;In every part of
a man's body a very slow fire is always burning.
The blood brings to the cells food from the intestine,
and air from the lungs. The food and air
join in a burning. The smoke goes back to the
blood and is carried to the lungs, and breathed out
with the breath. The ashes, also, go back to the
blood, and are carried away by the skin and kidneys.
The burning makes no flame or light for it
goes on very slowly. You cannot see the smoke,
but you can feel the warmth of the burning. Some
of the heat is turned to power, and gives the body
strength to do work. The body is like a steam
engine. It burns up all its food.</p>

<p><b>107. How the body is warmed.</b>&mdash;The body is
warmed by the slow burning in the cells. This
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
burning keeps the body always at the same warmth.
On a hot summer's day you feel warmer than on a
cold snowy morning. But your body is no warmer.
Only your skin is warmer.</p>

<p>If the skin is warm, the whole body feels warm,
but if the skin is cold, the whole body feels cold.
On a hot summer's day the heat is kept in the skin,
and we feel warm. On a cold winter's day a great
deal of heat passes off from the skin, and we feel
cold. Yet our bodies have the same warmth in
winter as in summer.</p>

<p><b>108. How the sweat keeps us cool.</b>&mdash;When your
hands or feet are wet, they are cold. On a hot
summer's day, your body becomes wet with sweat.
This cools the body as if water were poured over it.
So sweating keeps you from getting too warm, and
from being sunstruck.</p>

<p>We are sweating all the time, but the sweat
usually dries as fast as it forms. When we are
too warm it comes out faster than it dries. On a
winter's day we sweat only a little, and so we save
the heat. But more heat passes off from the skin
into the cold air, and we do not grow warmer.</p>

<p><b>109. Clothes.</b>&mdash;We wear clothes to keep the heat
in the body. They do not make heat, but they
keep it from going off. Wool and flannel clothes
keep the heat in better than cotton. We wear
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
woolen in the winter, and cotton in the summer.</p>

<p>Fur keeps in heat the best of all. In very cold
lands only fur is worn.</p>

<p>Linen lets heat out easily. It makes good summer
clothes.</p>

<p><b>110. Where to wear the most clothes.</b>&mdash;The face
and hands are kept warm by the blood and we do
not cover them except in the coldest weather. Our
feet are more tender and need to be covered enough
to keep them warm. We ought to wear thick-soled
shoes or rubbers in damp weather so as to keep
the feet dry and warm. We ought to dry the stockings
every night, for they will get wet with sweat.</p>

<p>The trunk of the body needs the most clothes.
The legs ought to be kept warm, too. If the dress
reaches only to the knee, thick underclothing is
needed for the lower part of the leg.</p>

<p>Do not keep one part of the body warm while
another part remains cold. It is wrong to bundle
the neck or wear too much clothing over any part
of the body. It is also wrong to wear too little and
be cold.</p>

<p>When you are moving about, you need less clothing
than when you are sitting still. When you
have worked until you are very warm, it is wrong
to stop to cool off. When you stop, you ought to
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
put on a thick coat or else go into the house. If
you do not, you may be chilled and made weak so
that you can easily catch cold or some other disease.</p>

<p><b>111. Heating houses.</b>&mdash;In winter our bodies cannot
make heat fast enough to keep us warm unless
we put on a great deal of clothing. So we warm
our houses. Our grandfathers used fireplaces, but
these did not give out much heat. People now
use stoves, but some use a furnace in the cellar,
or heat the rooms by steam. Some use kerosene
stoves, but they are not so good, for they make the
air bad. A room should feel neither too warm nor
too cold. It is of the right warmth when we do not
notice either heat or cold.</p>

<p><b>112. Change of air.</b>&mdash;After air has been breathed
it is no longer fit for use. In an hour or two you
would breathe all the air of a small room once if it
were not changed. When the air is partly used,
you feel dull and short of breath, and your head
aches. As soon as you get out of doors, you feel
better. Foul air of houses and meeting places often
contains disease germs. It is necessary to change
the air of all rooms often. You can do this by
opening a door or window. It is a good plan to
sleep with your bedroom window open, so as to get
good air all night.</p>

<p>Air passes in and out of every crack in the windows
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and doors. If only one person is in a room,
this may make enough change of air. If many persons
are in a room, you will need to change the air
in other ways. You can do this by opening a door
or window. Do not let the cold air blow upon any
one, for it may help to make him catch cold, if the
air of the room is impure. If we lower a window
from the top, warm impure air may pass out above
it without making a draft.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption2"><b>Diagram of the natural ventilation of a room.</b><br />
The arrows show the direction of the air currents.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
        You need fresh air at night as much as in the
daytime. You need not be afraid of the night air,
for it is good and pure like the day air. You
ought to sleep with your window open a little.
You ought to open the windows wide every morning
and air your bed well. At night you ought to
take off all your clothes and put on a night-dress.
Then hang your clothes up to air and dry.</p>

<p><b>113. When to air a room.</b>&mdash;When you first enter
a room full of bad air it smells musty and unpleasant.
But after you have been in the room
a while, you get used to it. If, however, you go
out of doors a minute and then come back, you
will smell the bad air again. If the air smells bad,
open a door or window until it is sweet again.</p>

<p><b>114. How to breathe.</b>&mdash;When you run hard, the
cells of your body use up all the air, and then you
feel short of breath. While you run, burning goes
on faster, and you feel warmer. You can work
harder and longer if you can breathe in a great
deal of air. You will also feel better and stronger
for it. Then if you are sick, you will be able to
get well more quickly. You ought to know how
to breathe right.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, you ought to breathe through your nose.
Even when you run, you ought to keep your mouth
closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
        <i>Second</i>, you should try to breathe deeply. You
should take a very deep breath often, and hold it as
long as you can. By practice you can learn to hold
it a full minute.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, you ought to run, or do some hard work,
every day. When you get short of breath, you will
have to breathe more deeply. After a while you
may be able to run a half mile, or even a mile, without
getting out of breath. But do not get tired out
in your run, for this will harm you.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, you must sit and stand with your shoulders
back, and your chest thrown forward. A
round-shouldered boy cannot have large lungs or
be long winded.</p>

<p>By breathing right, you can make your lungs
very much larger and stronger.</p>

<p><b>115. The voice.</b>&mdash;We talk by means of the breath.
At the upper part of the windpipe is a small box.
Its front corner can be felt in the neck, just under
the chin, and is called the <i>Adam's apple</i>. Two
thin, strong covers slide across the top of the box,
and can be made to meet in the middle. The
covers have sharp edges. When they are near
together, and air is breathed out between them, a
sound is made. This sound is the <i>voice</i>. The
tongue and lips change it to form <i>words</i>.</p>

<p><b>116. Care of the voice.</b>&mdash;The voice shows our
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
feelings, even if we do not tell them in words. We
can form a habit of speaking in a loud and harsh
tone, as if we were always angry, or we can speak
gently and kindly. We shall be more pleasant
company to others if we are careful always to speak
in gentle but distinct tones.</p>

</div>

<p>Shouting strains the voice and spoils its tone for
singing. Reading until the throat is tired makes
the voice weak. Singing or shouting in a cold or
damp air is also bad for the voice. Breathing
through the mouth is the worst of all for the
voice.</p>

<p><b>117. What becomes of alcohol in the body.</b>&mdash;When
alcohol is taken up by the blood, it is carried to the
liver. The liver tries to get rid of it by taking
some air from the blood and burning it up, just as
it burns the real food of the body. But this takes
some air from the cells of the body. Then they do
not burn as they should.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
        When a stove gets too little air through its draft,
it makes an unpleasant smoke, and cools off. Just
so, when the cells of the body do not burn as they
should, they produce the wrong kind of smoke and
ashes. This poisons the body and makes men sick.
The most of the poisoning of alcohol is due to
these new poisons.</p>

<p>When alcohol takes air from the cells of the
body, they do not get enough air. Then they are
like a short-winded boy, and do not do their work
well. In this way alcohol makes the body weak.</p>

<p>Alcohol does not cease to be harmful because it
is burned up in the body. It is harmful just because
it burns so quickly. Using alcohol in the body is
like trying to burn kerosene in a coal stove. The
body is not made to burn alcohol any more than a
coal stove is made to burn kerosene. You can
burn a little kerosene in a coal stove if you are
very careful. Just so, men can burn alcohol in
their bodies. But kerosene will always smoke and
clog up the stove, and may explode and kill some
one. So alcohol in the body burns quickly and
forms poisons. It always harms the body and
may destroy life at once.</p>

<p><b>118. Alcohol and the lungs.</b>&mdash;If you run a long
race, your lungs will need a great deal of air. If
you take strong drink, the alcohol will use up
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
much of the air, and you will not have enough
to use on your run. So you will feel short of
breath, and will surely lose the race. You cannot
drink and be long-winded.</p>

<p>Two drinks of whisky will use up as much air
as the body uses in an hour. It would be easy to
smother a person with strong drink. Drunken
persons are really smothered; they often die because
of the failure of their breathing, even while
their heart is able to beat well.</p>

<p>Alcohol often causes the lungs to become thickened.
Then air cannot easily pass through their
sides, and a person suffers from shortness of breath.
Sometimes these persons cannot lie down at all,
but must sit up to catch their breath.</p>

<p><b>119. Drinking and taking cold.</b>&mdash;A strong, healthy
man can stand a great deal of cold and wet. If he
breathes deeply in his work, all the cells of his body
get plenty of air, and if he eats good food, the cells
get plenty to eat. Then it will take a great deal to
harm them. But alcohol hinders the digestion of
their food, and also takes away their air. So the
cells are both starved and smothered, and are easily
hurt. Then a little cold and wet may do great
harm to his body, for a drinker cannot stand bad
weather or hard work so well as he could if he
should leave drink alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
        Men often drink to keep themselves from taking
cold. The alcohol really makes them more liable
to take cold. It causes the blood to flow near the
surface of the skin; there it is easily cooled, and
the drinker soon becomes chilled; then he feels
colder than ever. The cold harms the cells of his
body, and then the white blood cells cannot easily
fight disease germs. For this reason a drinker
easily takes cold and other diseases.</p>

<p><b>120. Alcohol lessens the warmth of the body.</b>&mdash;Alcohol
causes the blood tubes in the skin to become
larger. Then more blood will touch the cool
air, and the body will become cooler. But because
more warm blood flows through the skin, a man
feels warmer. But he is really colder. Alcohol
makes men less able to stand the cold. Travelers
in cold lands know this and do not use it.</p>

<p><b>121. How tobacco affects breathing.</b>&mdash;We would
not live in a room with a smoking stove. But
tobacco smoke is more harmful than smoke from
a stove, for it has nicotine in it. Tobacco smoke
in a room may make a child sick.</p>

<p>Cigarette smoking is very harmful to the lungs,
for the smoke is drawn deeply into them, and more
of the poison is likely to stay in the body. The
smoke of tobacco burns the throat and causes a
cough. This harms the voice.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Air is always being breathed into little sacs
inside the body. The sacs form the lungs.</p>
<p>2. The red blood cells pass through the lungs,
and take little loads of air. They then
carry the air through the arteries to the
capillaries.</p>
<p>3. In the capillaries the air leaves the red blood
cells, and goes to the cells of the body.</p>
<p>4. The air unites with the cells, and slowly burns
them to smoke and ashes.</p>
<p>5. The smoke goes back to the blood, and is
carried to the lungs and given off by the
breath. The ashes go back to the blood
and pass off through the skin and the kidneys.</p>
<p>6. The burning in the cells makes heat.</p>
<p>7. Some of the heat is changed to power, as it
is in a steam engine.</p>
<p>8. The heat also warms the body. It keeps it
at the same warmth on a cold day as on
a hot day.</p>
<p>9. We wear clothes to keep the heat in, and so
to keep us warm.</p>
<p>10. The air of a room needs to be changed often.
It is made stuffy by our breath.</p>

<p>12. Alcohol uses air belonging to the cells of the
body.</p>
<p>13. Tobacco smoke has the same poisons as tobacco.
It can poison the whole body through
the lungs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE SKIN AND KIDNEYS</h3>

<p><b>122. Waste matters.</b>&mdash;The food is burned in the
cells. As this burning goes on, the <i>smoke</i> goes off
by the lungs and the
unburned substances,
the <i>ashes</i>, go off by
the skin and kidneys.
The ashes are
mostly the minerals
of the cells, but there
are also some from
the burned albumin.
All these go back to
the blood and are
carried to the skin
and kidneys.</p>

<p class="caption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The skin (&#215;100).</b><br />

<i>e</i> sweat gland.<br />
<i>f</i> blood tubes.<br />
<i>h</i> fat pockets.</p>
</div>

<p><b>123. The skin.</b>&mdash;The
skin covers the
whole body. It is
strong and keeps the body from being hurt.</p>

<p><b>124. The epithelium.</b>&mdash;The skin is covered with
a thin layer of cells like fine scales. These scales
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
are called <i>epithelium</i>, or <i>epidermis</i>. They have no
blood tubes or nerves and so have no feeling.
You can run a pin under them without feeling
pain. They are always growing on their under
side and wearing off on their upper side. They
keep the nerves and blood tubes of the skin from
being hurt.</p>

<p><b>125. The nails.</b>&mdash;The top scales of epithelium
at the ends of the fingers become matted together
to make the nails. The nails keep the ends of
the fingers from being hurt. They can also be
used to hold or cut small things. The new parts
of the nails form under the skin and push down
the older parts. So the nail grows farther than
the end of the finger and needs to be cut off.
Biting the nails leaves their ends rough. Then
they may catch in the clothes and tear into the
tender flesh. We ought to keep the nails cut
even with the ends of the fingers.</p>

<p>The nails are not poisonous, but the dirt under
them may be. We ought to keep them clean.
Clean nails are one mark of a careful boy or girl.</p>

<p><b>126. Hair.</b>&mdash;Some of the scales of epithelium
over some parts of the body dip into tiny holes
in the skin. In each hole they become matted
together to form a <i>hair</i>. Fine short hair grows
on almost every part of the body. On the top
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of the head it grows long and thick. When boys
become men, it also grows long upon their faces.
The skin pours out a kind of oil to keep the hair
soft and glossy.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 225px;">
<a name="i0077-illus" id="i0077-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0077-illus.jpg" width="150" height="153" alt="Hair" title=""/>
<p class="caption">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A hair (&#215;200).</b><br />

</div>

<p><b>127. Care of
the hair.</b>&mdash;The
hair may become
dirty like
any other part
of the body.
Brushing it
takes out a
great deal of
dirt, but you
should also
wash it once a
week.</p>

<p>The oil in
the skin ought
to be enough
for the hair.
Hair oils do not do the hair any good. If you
wet the hair too often, you may make it stiff
and take away its gloss. It is best to comb the
hair dry. Brush it so as to spread the oil of
the skin. Hair dyes are poisonous, and ought not
to be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
        <b>128. The sweat or perspiration.</b>&mdash;The scales of
epithelium dip into the skin and there line tiny
tubes. The tubes form the <i>sweat</i>, or <i>perspiration</i>,
out of the blood. The tubes are too fine to be
seen, but they are upon almost every part of the
body. They take the ashes or other waste matter
or poisons from the blood and wash them out of
the tubes with the perspiration. So the perspiration
has two uses. First, it takes heat away from
the body (see &sect; <a href="#Page_63">108</a>). Second, it gets rid of the
waste matters or ashes of the body. It has very
little of these at any one time, but in a day it gets
rid of a great deal.</p>

<p><b>129. The kidneys.</b>&mdash;The kidneys are close to the
backbone, below the heart. They are made of
tiny tubes much like the sweat tubes in the skin.
The tubes take ashes and other waste matters from
the blood, also a great deal of water. They also take
away poisons and disease germs when we are sick.
The kidneys take away about as much water as the
skin, but they get rid of very much more poisons
and waste matters than the skin does. If our kidneys
should stop their work, we should soon die.</p>

<p><b>130. Need of bathing.</b>&mdash;When the perspiration
dries from the skin, it leaves the waste and poisons
behind. We cannot always see the dried matters,
but they always have an unpleasant odor. We
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
should bathe often enough to keep our body from
having an unpleasant smell. We should wash the
whole body with soap and hot water at least once a
week in winter and more often than that in summer.</p>

<p>Another reason for bathing is to wash disease
germs from the body. Most dirt has disease germs
in it. Disease germs also float in the dust of the
air and stick to our skin when we go into a dusty
room. If our skin is dirty, some of the germs may
be carried into our flesh when our skin is pricked,
or scratched, or cut. We sometimes catch boils, or
erysipelas, or lockjaw, from very little wounds in a
dirty skin. Cleanliness of our skin helps to keep
us from catching diseases.</p>

<p><b>131. Cold baths.</b>&mdash;Sometimes we bathe when we
are clean so as to get refreshed. If we bathe in
cold water, we feel cold at first. In a little while
we feel warm again. Then we feel stronger, and
refreshed for work. If we stay in the bath too long,
we become cold again and feel weak. When boys
go in swimming, they ought to come out before
they begin to feel cold.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to take a cold bath every morning
when you get up, even if you use only a wash-bowl
with a little water. It will take only a few
minutes, but will keep you clean and make you feel
more like doing your day's work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
        <b>132. A fair skin.</b>&mdash;We must wash often, to make
the skin fair and smooth. Use enough good soap
to keep the skin clean.</p>

<p>If you eat as you should, and digest the food
well, your skin will have the least amount of waste
to give off. Then it will look well. A bad looking
skin is due to bad food and to bad digestion. If
you do not digest your food well, you cannot have
a fair skin.</p>

<p>Face paint and powder make the skin look worse,
for they hinder perspiration. Nothing of that sort
will do the skin any good. You must eat as you
should, and you must keep clean. Then your skin
will be clear.</p>

<p><b>133. Washing clothes.</b>&mdash;Our clothes rub off a
great deal of the perspiration and waste. They
become soiled. A great deal of dirt also gets upon
the sheets of our beds. Our clothes need to be
washed as well as our bodies when they are soiled.
Air and the sun as well as water destroy the waste
of the body. Our clothes need to be aired at night,
and the bed and bedroom should be aired through
the day.</p>

<p><b>134. Slops.</b>&mdash;After water has been used to wash
our body or our clothes it is dirty and is not fit to
be used again. It must not be thrown where it can
run into a well. If a person has typhoid fever or
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
cholera or other catching disease, the water may
carry germs of the disease to the well, and so other
persons may get it. Slops from the house should
not be poured out at the back door, but they should
be carried away from the house. In cities the slops
are poured into large pipes and tunnels underground.
These pipes are called <i>sewers</i>. They
empty outside the city.</p>

<p><b>135. Alcohol and the skin.</b>&mdash;Alcohol interferes
with digestion and causes biliousness. This makes
the skin rough and pimply. A drinker seldom has
a clear skin.</p>

<p>Alcohol causes the arteries of the face to become
enlarged. Then the face is red. A red nose is one
of the signs of drinking. When a person uses
strong drink he is often uncleanly. He does not
care for the bad looks of his clothes and skin, and
so he lets them stay dirty. This harms the skin
and makes it look bad. The dirt also poisons the
skin and may itself be a cause of sickness.</p>

<p>Because alcohol poisons the whole body and
often produces kidney diseases, the drinker is apt
to catch other diseases. Drinkers are the first to
catch such diseases as smallpox and yellow fever.
Where there are great numbers of cases, the
drinkers are the first and often the only persons
to die. This is because their skin and kidneys
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
have been harmed by the alcohol and cannot throw
off the poisons of the disease. Any kind of sickness
will be worse in a drinker. Surgeons do not
like to operate on drinkers, for their wounds do not
heal so quickly as in other people.</p>

<p>When there is too little air, a fire burns slower,
and makes a blacker smoke and more ashes. Alcohol
takes some air from the cells of the body. So
they burn with smoke and ashes of the wrong kind.
The skin has to work harder to get rid of these,
and sometimes it cannot do it well. Then the body
is poisoned. The alcohol is burned and cannot
poison the body any more. But it causes the body
to make poisons, and so it is to blame. The poisons
do great harm to the skin and kidneys. Alcohol
causes more kidney disease than all other things
put together.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Little tubes in the skin are always giving off
ashes and waste matters in the perspiration.</p>
<p>2. Perspiration dries on the skin. So the skin
must be washed often.</p>
<p>3. The kidneys get rid of more water and waste
matter than the skin does.</p>
<p>4. Perspiration also gets upon the clothes and bed
sheets. These must be washed too.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
        5. Dirty water from washing should be thrown out
where it cannot run into a well.</p>
<p>6. The skin is thick and strong and keeps the body
from being hurt.</p>
<p>7. The skin is covered with a layer of scales. The
scales have no feeling.</p>
<p>8. The scales form the nails on the ends of the
fingers.</p>
<p>9. The scales also form the hair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE NERVES, SPINAL CORD, AND BRAIN</h3>

<p><b>136. Need of nerves.</b>&mdash;The cells of the mouth,
stomach, and intestine digest food; the cells of
the liver change the food to blood; the cells of the
heart pump the blood to feed all the cells of the
body; the red blood cells carry air for the cells to
breathe; and the cells of the skin and kidneys
carry away the waste of the rest of the cells. Each
set of cells works for all the rest. If the cells of the
body were only tied together, each one would do as
it pleased, and no two would work together. But
something tells each cell of the body to work with
the others. The cells all obey the mind. A tiny
thread goes to each cell of the body. Each thread
is a <i>nerve</i>. The mind and the cells signal to each
other over the nerves. By means of the nerves the
mind makes the cells work together.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
        <b>137. Nerve messages.</b>&mdash;The nerve threads run in
bundles and form nerves large enough to be seen.
The mind uses the nerves to tell the cells to do
work. It tells the muscles
to move the arms and legs.
It tells the heart to beat
and stomach to pour out
gastric juice; and it tells
each of the cells to eat.</p>

<p>The cells also send word
over the nerves to the mind.
They tell the mind when
they are touching anything,
and whether it is hard, or
smooth, or hot, and many other things about it.
The cells also tell the mind if they need more
food, or are tired.</p>

<p>The nerves are always carrying messages to and
from the cells. The cells depend upon these messages
to tell them when and how to work. If the
nerve of any part of the body is hurt or cut, we
cannot feel with the part or move it, and its cells
do not act in the right way. We do not feel the
nerves while they are carrying the messages. We
wish the cells of the arm to work, and they work,
but we do not feel the message as it goes from the
mind to the cells of the arm.</p>

<div class="figleft bord" style="width: 225px;">

<img src="images/i0086-illus.jpg" width="150" height="96" alt="The spinal cord" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>A thin slice from the spinal cord with the<br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
        <b>138. The spinal cord.</b>&mdash;The nerves start inside the
backbone. The backbone is hollow. It has a soft,
white cord inside, as
thick as the little finger.
Part of the mind lives
in this cord. The cord
is called the <i>spinal cord</i>.
Some of the nerves
start from cells of the
spinal cord. These
cells send word to the
muscles to move and
to all the cells of the body to eat and grow. They
also send word to the arteries to carry the right
amount of blood to the cells.</p>

<p>From the nerves the spinal cord gets word when
something hurts any part of the body. You may
put your finger on a sharp pin. The spinal cord
feels the prick, and quickly sends word to snatch
the finger away. So the finger is taken away
before you really feel the prick. When some one
sticks a pin into you, you cannot help jumping.
This is because the spinal cord sends word for you
to jump away from the pin before it can harm you
much. Thus the spinal cord keeps the body from
being hurt. It acts while we are asleep as well as
when we are awake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
        <b>139. Need of a spinal cord.</b>&mdash;We do not feel the
spinal cord acting, and we cannot keep it from acting.
It tells the cells when to eat and grow, and it
tells the heart and arteries how much blood to send
to each cell. If we had to think about feeding an
arm or a leg, we should sometimes forget it, but the
spinal cord keeps doing it without our thinking of
it. We put food into the body, and the spinal cord
tells the cells to use it. If it stops acting for an
instant, the cells stop work and we die. We cannot
change its action by any amount of thinking.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0087-illus" id="i0087-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0087-illus.jpg" width="500" height="547" alt="The human head" title=""/>
<p class="caption2"><b>Regions of the head and action of the different parts<br />
of the brain.</b></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
        <b>140. The brain.</b>&mdash;The nerves of the body go to
the brain as well as to the spinal cord. The brain
lies in the top of the head. A hard cover of bone
keeps it from getting hurt. It is a soft white mass,
and weighs about three pounds. Its outside is made
of cells, while its inside is the very beginning of the
nerves of the body.</p>

<p><b>141. The mind.</b>&mdash;The mind is the real man. It
is the thinking part of himself. It lives in the body
and works by means of the cells of the brain. If
these cells are hurt or killed, the body seems to
have no mind, but yet it may keep on living. If all
the mind leaves the body, the body is dead.</p>

<p>By means of the mind we feel, and know, and
think. The mind uses each part of the brain for
only one kind of work.</p>

<p><b>142. The senses.</b>&mdash;The cells of the body send
word to the brain over the nerves. The eye tells
of sight, the ear of sounds, the nose of odors, the
mouth of tastes, and the skin of feelings. All these
messages go to the back part of the brain. They
tell the mind of the news outside of the body. We
get all our knowledge in this way. The cells also
tell of their need of food and drink by means of
the feelings of hunger and thirst.</p>

<p><b>143. Motion.</b>&mdash;The mind in the cells of the top
part of the head sends the orders for moving the
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
different parts of the body. When we wish to
run, the mind in the top of our head sends an
order over our nerves to our legs, and they carry
the body where we wish. If the top part of your
brain is hurt, as by a blow, it cannot send orders
to move, but you will lie stunned.</p>

<p><b>144. Memory.</b>&mdash;The mind lays away all its messages,
and often looks them over again. These old
messages are called <i>memories</i>. They always stay
with the brain, and the mind can call them up at
any time. Our memories make our knowledge.</p>

<p>Every act of the mind leaves some mark on the
memory. We may not be able to bring it back
when we want to, but it will come back some time.
Every bad word and evil deed will tend to come
back and make us bad again. Every good work
and word will leave its memory and make us
better. We ought to fill our minds with good
memories.</p>

<p><b>145. Thinking.</b>&mdash;The brain also thinks. Thinking
is different from feeling and from moving, but
we can think about our feelings and about our
movements. The brain just back of the forehead
does all our thinking. A dog has only a little
forehead, and cannot think much. But the rest
of its brain is large, for it can see and hear and
run as well as a man. A baby can see and hear
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
and move, but it cannot think until it is taught
how. Boys and girls go to school to learn to think.
Thinking is work, just as truly as running is work.
At school, no one can learn to think without working.
Looking at things and hearing some one
talk about them will not make you a strong-minded
man, but thinking about these things will. Boys
and girls should study and think, as well as look
around and listen.</p>

<p><b>146. How thought rules the body.</b>&mdash;We are
always feeling and moving. We often do these
things without trying, but we must make ourselves
think. We can make our bodies move, or keep
still, and we can keep from too much feeling. Our
thoughts direct our natural desires to move and
feel. In an animal, the feelings and movements
direct the thoughts. When men let their feelings
rule their thoughts, they are like animals. When
the thoughts control the feelings and acts, we are
men. If you get angry and cry, when you hurt
your finger, then you are like an animal; but if
you think about it and control your feelings, you
are behaving like a strong and noble man. The
thought part of the brain ought to rule all the
rest.</p>

<p><b>147. Sleep.</b>&mdash;Most of the brain does its work
without our knowing it, but we know when we
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
think. The thinking part of the brain gets tired,
like any other part of the body. When it stops
work, we are asleep.</p>

<p>We must give the brain a rest in sleep, just as
we must rest an arm or a leg. We ought to give
it regular rest. Every night we ought to go to
bed early. Then we shall be ready to get up early
and shall feel like working. Boys and girls need
nine or ten hours' sleep each day. When they
are grown, they need seven or eight hours' sleep
each day.</p>

<p>The spinal cord and some parts of the brain
must always stay awake to make the cells of the
body eat and grow. When we are asleep, they
must be wide awake, and must repair the worn-out
parts. They do not seem to rest at all. If they
rested for any length of time, then the lungs, heart,
stomach and all other parts of the body would stop
work, and we should die. But they really rest a part
of the time. Like the heart, they act for a second,
and then stop for a second. They seem to act all
the time, but in all they rest half the time.</p>

<p><b>148. Worry.</b>&mdash;The mind can do a great deal of
work, if it gets good sleep. If a person gets
enough sleep and rest, he cannot harm his mind
by hard work. Sometimes the mind is troubled
and worried over a danger or a loss. Then
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
it cannot rest, but soon wears itself out. Worry is
far more tiresome than hard work. By an effort,
we can keep from worrying. It never does us
good to worry, and we ought to keep from it.</p>

<p><b>149. Nervousness.</b>&mdash;The thoughts are able to
rule all the rest of the mind. They can keep us
from feeling ill-tempered when we cannot have our
own way. Sometimes a little unpleasant feeling
makes us very unhappy, and keeps us from thinking
about our work. A little noise or pain keeps
some children from study, while others can bear
a great deal without being disturbed by it. Some
persons jump at a little noise, and are afraid of
a tiny bug or mouse. This is because their feelings
rule their thoughts. Such persons are called
<i>nervous</i>.</p>

<p>A nervous person is very uncomfortable and
makes others so too. Yet any one can get over the
habit of being nervous, if he will try. You ought
not to laugh at a nervous person if he is afraid
of some little thing while you are not. You should
help him to get over his nervousness and to become
brave.</p>

<p><b>150. Fear.</b>&mdash;Some persons are always brave. In
danger they calmly stop to think, and then know
how to save themselves. A timid person does not
think, but rushes where his feelings lead. When
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a crowd is in danger, all will rush to do one thing.
All will run for a door, and perhaps tread on one
another. Then some one will surely be hurt. At
a fire, or in any other danger, you should always
stop to think how to act. If you rush with the
crowd, you may be hurt. You will be more likely
to be safe, if you stay away from them. Then, if
help comes, you will be able to receive it. Besides,
if you are cool and brave, you will help others
around you to be brave too.</p>

<p><b>151. Fire drill.</b>&mdash;In schools the children are
taught how to go out of the building when there is
a fire. A bell is struck when the children do not
expect it. Then every child must leave his seat at
once and march out of the building. The bell is
struck every few days. Then, when the bell really
sounds for a fire, the children know how to march
out quickly, and so they learn to be brave.</p>

<p>By training we can learn to be brave at all times.
We fear many harmless things, and in many cases
do not fear real dangers. We are liable to be hurt
at any time. We are more liable to be hurt by a
horse when we are out driving than we are by the
dark. Yet we do not fear the horse, while some do
fear the dark. We ought to learn to think, so as to
control our fear.</p>

<p>Some are afraid of the dark, some are frightened
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
by ghost stories, and others expect to see a wild
animal jump from behind every bush. No one
fears these things unless he has been told about
them. We ought to be careful not to tell children
of these things. We ought to teach them to control
their fear.</p>

<p><b>152. Habit.</b>&mdash;After we have thought about a
thing a few times, its hold on our memory becomes
strong, and leads us to think about it often. When
we have done a thing a few times, we are likely to
do it again without knowing it. We call this doing
things over again <i>habit</i>. When we once form a
habit, we find it very hard to break. We can form
habits of doing right or of doing wrong. We can
get into the habit of swearing or of drinking by
doing these things a few times. Then we shall do
these things when we do not want to. When a
drinker begins, he does not expect to keep on
drinking. But his habit makes him drink, and he
cannot help it. We should be careful not to do
bad things, for we easily form the habit of doing
them.</p>

<p><b>153. Good habits.</b>&mdash;We can form habits of doing
right. We can speak kindly and be generous.
Then we shall do these things as easily as others
get cross. After a person has tried to do good a
few times, he will find it much easier to do good.
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
Then he will speak kindly and give generously just
as easily as others get angry and keep their good
things to themselves.</p>

<p><b>154. Alcohol takes away thought.</b>&mdash;Alcohol affects
and weakens the cells of the brain sooner than it
does those of any other part of the body. It first
makes the thought cells weak. Then a person does
not think how he acts. He lights his pipe in the
barn and throws the match in the hay. He drives
his horse on a run through a crowded street. He
swears and uses bad language. He gets angry at
little things and wants to fight. He seems to think
of himself, and of no one else. He is happy, for
he does not think of the bad effects of the drink.
He has a good time, and does not care for its
cost. He likes to drink, because it makes him feel
happy.</p>

<p><b>155. Alcohol spoils motion.</b>&mdash;Some cells of the
brain cause the arms and legs, and all other parts
of the body, to move. Alcohol next makes these
weak. Then a person cannot move his legs right,
but he staggers when he walks. He cannot carry
a full cup to his lips. His hands tremble, and he
cannot take care of himself. He is now really
drunk.</p>

<p><b>156. Alcohol takes away feeling.</b>&mdash;After a man is
drunk, he loses the sense of feeling. He does not
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
feel cuts and blows. Because he does not feel tired,
he feels very strong. He often sees two things for
one, and hears strange noises. The whole brain at
last gets weak, and cannot act. Then the drinker
lies down in a drunken sleep, and cannot be waked
up. Some die in this state.</p>

<p><b>157. Insanity.</b>&mdash;When the brain is misused by
alcohol for some time, it cannot get over it. Then
the person becomes insane. Drink sends more persons
to the insane asylum than all other causes put
together.</p>

<p><b>158. Delirium tremens.</b>&mdash;If a drinker gets hurt,
or becomes sick, he sometimes has terrible dreams.
In them he sees dirty and savage animals coming
to harm him. These dreams seem very real to
him, and he cries out in his fright. This is called
<i>delirium tremens</i>. A person is liable to die from it.</p>

<p><b>159. Alcohol harms a drinker's children.</b>&mdash;The
children of drinkers are apt to be weak in body and
mind. A drinker hurts his children even more
than he hurts himself. They are liable to catch
diseases, and are often cross and nervous, or weak-minded.
It is a terrible thing for a man to make
his children weak and nervous.</p>

<p><b>160. Other bad things about drink.</b>&mdash;There are
many other terrible things about drink, besides the
harm it does a man's body. Many a man has
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
made himself drunk so as to steal or kill. No man
can drink long without becoming a worse man for
it. Men will not trust him, and he loses the respect
of his friends.</p>

<p>Making strong drink takes thousands of men
away from good work. They might work at building
houses, or raising grain, or teaching school.
As it is, their work is wasted.</p>

<p>A great deal of money is wasted on strong drink.
All the mines of the world cannot produce enough
gold and silver to pay the drink bill. The people
of the United States pay more for strong drink
than for bread.</p>

<p>The price of two or three drinks a day would
amount to enough, in ten years, to buy a small
home.</p>

<p>The cost of strong drink is made much greater
if we count the cost of jails and insane asylums.
Over one half of all crimes and cases of insanity are
caused by strong drink.</p>

<p>We must also add the misery and suffering of
most children of drunken fathers. This loss cannot
be counted in money. Numbers of children become
truants from school and learn theft and falsehoods
from lack of a father's care. When all the
cost is counted, nothing will be found so expensive
as strong drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
        On the other hand, what do people get for their
money and suffering? They get only a little
pleasure, and then they are ashamed of it. Men
use strong drink only because they like it more
than they dislike its bad effects.</p>

<p>Since drink does a great deal of harm, with no
good to any one, it is right to make laws to control
its sale.</p>

<p><b>161. How tobacco affects the brain.</b>&mdash;Some men
smoke to make themselves think, and some to keep
themselves from thinking. Now, smoking cannot
do both things. It really makes the brain less able
to think, for it weakens the whole body. A school-boy's
brain will surely be harmed if he uses tobacco
at all.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The mind makes all the cells of the body work
together.</p>
<p>2. Tiny nerve threads carry messages from the
mind to the cells.</p>
<p>3. Most of the nerves begin at the spinal cord in
the backbone.</p>
<p>4. The mind in the spinal cord tells the cells to
eat and grow. It tells the arteries how much
blood to carry to the cells.</p>
<p>5. The cells tell the spinal cord if they need food,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
or if something suddenly hurts them. The
spinal cord sends word to snatch the part
from danger.</p>
<p>6. Nerves carry to the brain news of sight, sound,
odor, taste, and touch.</p>
<p>7. The brain sends word to the muscles to move
the arms, the legs, and the rest of the body.</p>
<p>8. The brain thinks.</p>
<p>9. The brain stores up all its messages; these
make memory and knowledge.</p>
<p>10. The thought part of the brain can control the
feelings and the movements of the body.</p>
<p>11. Alcohol is more harmful to the brain than to
any other part of the body.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE SENSES</h3>

<p><b>162.</b> A man has five ways of knowing about
things outside of the body. He can feel, see, hear,
smell, and taste.</p>

<p><b>163. Feeling.</b>&mdash;Nerves go to nearly every cell in
the body. They carry news to the brain when
anything touches them. The news produces a
feeling. Feelings are of three kinds:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First</i>, when anything touches the cells without
harming them, we feel a <i>touch</i>. We feel a
touch by nerves in the skin. Those in the ends of
the fingers and tongue can feel the best. Those
upon the back give but little feeling.</p>

<p>Touch tells whether anything is hard, or rough, or
round, or square, or has other qualities and shapes.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, when anything touches the bare nerves
or hurts the cells, we feel a <i>pain</i>. We can feel a
pain anywhere in the body. Pain tells us if we are
being harmed. If we had no feeling of pain, we
might be killed before we could know of our
danger. Pain warns us away from danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
        <i>Third</i>, we can feel <i>heat</i> and <i>cold</i>. Anything
very hot or very cold, however, makes only a pain
and gives no feeling either of cold or of heat.</p>

<p><b>164. Sight.</b>&mdash;We see with our eyes. An eye is a
hollow ball. In its front is a clear window. Behind
the window is a round curtain with a round hole in
its middle. When we speak of the color of the
eye, we mean the color of this curtain. Light passes
through the hole in the curtain and falls upon some
nerves in the back of the eyeballs. There it forms
a picture like a photograph. The nerves carry this
picture to the brain, and we see it.</p>

</table>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
        <b>165. Movements of the eyes.</b>&mdash;We can turn our
eyes so as to look in any direction. Sometimes a
person has one eye turned sidewise. Such a person
is cross-eyed, and sees well out of only one eye at a
time. Glasses may help the eyes, but sometimes
a surgeon has to cut a tiny muscle.</p>

<p><b>166. Coverings of the eyes.</b>&mdash;The eyeballs lie in
a bony case, upon a soft bed of fat. In front each
is covered with two lids. We can shut the lids to
keep out dust and insects. When we are sleepy,
they come together and cover the eyes. Little
hairs at their edges help to keep out the dust.</p>

<p>Sometimes a little dirt gets under the lids. Then
the eye smarts or itches, and we want to rub it;
but this may grind the dirt in deeper. Then you
should get some one else to lift your eyelid and
pick out the dust with a soft handkerchief. If you
cannot get help, lift the lid by the eyelashes; blow
your nose hard, and the tears may wash the dirt
away.</p>

<p>Dust and disease germs may get into our eyes
and make them sore and red. You should bathe
your eyes well every time you wash your face. You
should use a clean towel, for a dirty one may carry
disease germs to your eyes. Some forms of sore
eyes are catching. If any one has sore eyes, no
one else should use his towels or handkerchiefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
        <b>167. Tears.</b>&mdash;Clear salt water is always running
over the eyes and down a tube into the nose. The
use of this water is to bathe the eyes and keep them
clean. It sometimes runs over the lids in drops
called <i>tears</i>.</p>

<p><b>168. How to use the eyes.</b>&mdash;If using your eyes
makes them painful or gives you a headache, you
are straining your eyes. Facing a bright light
strains the eyes. Shade your eyes while you
study. A cap may be used as a shade if you
cannot get anything else. Never try to look at
the sun or a very bright light. You should have
the light at one side or behind you. The light
should be steady. Reading in a dim light will harm
the eyes.</p>

<p><b>169. Near sight.</b>&mdash;If you cannot read without
holding your book less than a foot from your eyes,
you are nearsighted, and should wear glasses all
the time. If you do this, your eyes may be strong,
and you may be able to see well.</p>

<p><b>170. Far sight.</b>&mdash;If you cannot read without holding
your book at arm's length, you are farsighted
and need glasses. Most old persons are farsighted.</p>

<p><b>171. Alcohol and the eyes.</b>&mdash;Alcohol makes the
eyes red. It weakens the eyes and may produce
blindness. A drunken person often sees double.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
        <b>172. Tobacco</b> causes dimness of sight and sometimes
produces blindness.</p>

<p><b>173. Hearing.</b>&mdash;We hear with the ears. Sound
is made by waves in the air. The part of the
ear on the outside of the head catches the air
waves and throws them inside the ear. These
air waves strike against a little drum. Three little
bones then carry the waves on to nerves farther
inside the head. Animals can turn their ears and
catch sound from any direction.</p>

</div>

<p><b>174. Ear wax.</b>&mdash;Wax is formed just inside the
ear. It keeps flies and insects from crawling into
the ear. Boys in swimming sometimes get cold
water into their ears. This may make them have
an earache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
        <b>175. How the throat affects the ear.</b>&mdash;An air tube
runs from the inside of the ear to the mouth.
Sometimes when you blow your nose, you blow
air into the ear. This makes you partly deaf and
you hear a roaring in your ears.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you have a cold in your throat,
this little tube is stopped. Then your ear may
ache and may even discharge matter. This may
make you somewhat deaf. Earache and deafness
are most often due to a cold in the throat and a
stoppage of this tube.</p>

<p>Many little boys and girls are deaf and do not
know it. They cannot hear the teacher well, and
sometimes the teacher thinks they are bad or careless
because they do not answer.</p>

<p><b>176. Care of the ears.</b>&mdash;Very loud noises may
harm the ear and make you deaf. When you
expect a very loud noise, put your fingers in your
ears to shut out the sound.</p>

<p>Boxing the ears may break their tiny drums
and make you deaf.</p>

<p>Do not get cold water in your ear. This may
cause an earache and make you deaf. If you get
water in your ear while you are in swimming,
turn your head to one side and shake it. This
will get the water out.</p>

<p>Do not put cotton or anything else into your ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
        <b>177. Smell.</b>&mdash;We smell with the nose. Some
things give out a vapor to the air. When we
draw the air into the nose, this vapor touches the
nerves, and we perceive a smell. The nerves are
high up in the nose. In order to perceive smell
clearly, we sniff the air far up the nose.</p>

<p><b>178. Use of smell.</b>&mdash;Bad air and spoiled food
smell bad. A bad smell is the sign of something
spoiled. The sense of smell tells us when food
or air is unfit for use. Some people try to hide
a bad smell with perfumery. To do this only
makes the danger greater, for then the smell does
not tell us of the danger of food or air.</p>

<p>Some animals can smell much better than a
man. A dog will smell the track of a wild animal
hours after it is made. Savages can smell much
better than civilized men.</p>

<p><b>179. Taste.</b>&mdash;We taste with the tongue. Dry
food has no taste, but it must first dissolve in
the mouth. Spoiled food tastes bad. Bad-tasting
food is not fit to eat. Taste tells us whether food
is good or bad.</p>

<p>We can learn to like the taste of harmful things.
At first no one likes tobacco or strong drink, but
the liking is formed the more one uses these.
We ought to be careful not to begin to use
such things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
        <i>Alcohol</i> and <i>tobacco</i> burn the mouth and harm
the taste. Food does not taste so good and we
may eat spoiled food and not know it.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. We can feel in every part of the body, but
mostly in the ends of the fingers.</p>
<p>2. Light makes a picture upon the nerves inside
of the eye.</p>
<p>3. If the eyes ache, the light should be softened
or the position of the book or work changed,
or else the eyes should be rested.</p>
<p>4. Sound in the air goes into the ear and strikes
against a drum. Bones then carry the sound
to the ear nerves.</p>
<p>5. Air snuffed up the nose gives the sense of
smell. Smell tells us if the air or food is
fit for use.</p>
<p>6. Taste tells us whether food is fit for use. Men
can learn to like the taste of wrong things
like tobacco or alcohol.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>BONES AND JOINTS</h3>

<p><b>180.</b> Bones make the body stiff and strong, and
give it shape. Long bones reach through the
arms and legs, and little bones reach down the fingers
and toes. Rounded plates of bone form the
head, and a pile of bony rings makes up the backbone.
Each bone is built to fit exactly into its
own place and to do its own work. In all there
are over two hundred bones in the body. They
form one seventh of its weight.</p>

<p><b>181. Form of bones.</b>&mdash;A bone is not like a solid
piece of timber, but is hollow like the frame of a
bicycle. This makes it strong and light. At its
ends a bone is like a hard sponge covered with a
firm shell. This makes it too strong to be easily
crushed, and keeps it light.</p>

<p>A bone grows like any other part of the body.
It is made of living cells like woven threads. Lime
is mixed among the cells, and makes them stiff like
starch among the threads of a linen collar. Blood
tubes go through every part of the bone so as to
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
feed the cells. The living cells form one third of
the bone, while the lime forms two thirds.</p>

<p><b>182. Broken bones.</b>&mdash;Bones are very hard, and
yet they can bend a little without breaking. Most
of them are curved a little, and so they will spring
instead of breaking when they are pressed hard.
But sometimes they break. Then a person must
wear a splint and bandage to keep the bones in
place until they grow together again. The living
cells will mend a bone in about a month.</p>

<p>An old person's bones are more tender than a
child's, and will not spring much without breaking.
An old man is afraid of falling and breaking his
bones, while a child falls a dozen times a day without
danger.</p>

<p>The bones of some children bend too easily.
When they stand, the bones of their legs bend a
little. After a while they grow in the crooked
shape, and the child is bow-legged.</p>

<p><b>183. Joints.</b>&mdash;Some bones are hinged upon each
other. A bone hinge is a <i>joint</i>. The rings of the
backbone are held together by very tough pads
of flesh. Each pad lets the backbone bend only a
little, but altogether they let us bend our backs in
any direction. These pads are like rubber springs
in a wagon, and keep our bodies from being jarred
too much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
        The finger and toe joints, the wrists and ankles,
the elbows and the knees, bend back and forth like
a hinge. Tough bands of flesh bind the bones
together. The ends of the bones are rounded
and smooth. They fit together and make perfect
hinges. The joints are oiled by
a fluid like the white of an egg.
In old people this fluid sometimes
dries up. Then the joints become
stiff, and creak like a squeaking
hinge.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 225px;">
<a name="i0111-illus" id="i0111-illus"></a>
<img src="images/i0111-illus.jpg" width="150" height="245" alt="The elbow" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>Hinge joint of the elbow.</b><br />
1 humerus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 ulna</p>
</div>

<p>The shoulders and hips can be
moved in every direction. The
upper ends of the arm and leg
bones are round like half a ball.
They fit into cups on the shoulder
and hip bones. They are
very smooth, and are oiled like the hinge joints.
The joints are made to work very smoothly and
easily.</p>

<p><b>184. Bones out of joint.</b>&mdash;When the ends of bones
are torn away from each other, the bone is out of
joint. Then the bone cannot be moved without
great pain. It should be put back in place at once
and kept there by splints and bandages. A person
is less liable to have his joints out of place than he
is to have his bones broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
        <b>185. Sprains.</b>&mdash;Sometimes a joint is turned too
much. This stretches the flesh around the joint,
and makes it very tender and painful. This is a
<i>sprain</i>. When you sprain a joint, you should put it
in hot water for an hour or two. Then keep it
still for a few days.</p>

<p><b>186. Why bones and joints grow wrong.</b>&mdash;While
bones and joints are growing they can be made to
take any shape we please. They cannot be bent
all at once, but if we hold them in one way much of
the time, they will keep that shape. Some boys and
girls sit with their backs bent forward and lean
against the desk as if they were too lazy to sit up.
When they grow up, they will be bent and round-shouldered.
You should sit and stand straight.
Then you will grow tall and straight and strong.
A soldier has square shoulders and walks erect
because he is drilled until his bones and joints grow
in the proper shape. As you stand straight with
your feet together, your two big toes, your two
ankles, and your two knees should touch each
other.</p>

<p>If you wear tight shoes and press the toes out of
shape, they will soon grow so. Nearly every one's
feet are out of shape from wearing short, pointed
shoes. Your toes should be straight and not
cramped by the shoe. If you wear narrow shoes,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
you may harm your feet. It is better to have one's
feet useful, even if they are large, than to make
them small and useless.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Bones make the body stiff, and give it form.</p>
<p>2. Some bones are long, some round, and some flat.
All are hard and springy.</p>
<p>3. Some bones are hinged together. The hinge
is a joint.</p>
<p>4. The ends of bones in joints are rounded and
smooth, and are oiled with a liquid like the
white of an egg.</p>
<p>5. Some bones are bound together by springy pads,
as in the backbone.</p>
<p>6. Bones can be broken. They will grow together
again themselves.</p>
<p>7. Joints can be put out of place; then we must
put them back.</p>
<p>8. If joints or bones are kept in wrong positions
they will grow into bad shapes. Tight shoes
deform the feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>MUSCLES</h3>

<p><b>187. Shape of muscles.</b>&mdash;Bones are covered with
muscles. Muscles give shape to the body, and
move it about. One half of the body consists of
muscles. These are arranged in bundles, and each
causes a bone to make one motion. There are over
four hundred separate bundles of muscle in the body.</p>

<p>One end of a muscle is large and round and is
fast to a bone. The other end tapers to a strong
string or tendon. The tendon passes over a joint,
and becomes fast to another
bone. You can easily feel
the tendons in the wrist and
behind the knee.</p>

<div class="figright bord" style="width: 225px;">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cells together.</p>
</div>

<p>A muscle is made of tiny
strings. You can pick them
apart until they are too fine
to be seen with the eye. Each
string is a living muscle cell.
It is the largest kind of cell
in the body. You can see the fine strings in cooked
meat.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
        <b>188. How muscles act.</b>&mdash;A nerve runs from the
brain, and touches every cell of the muscle. When
we wish to move, the brain sends an order down
the nerve. Then each muscle
cell makes itself thicker
and shorter. This pulls its
ends together, and bends the
joint. We can make muscle
cells move when we wish to,
but we cannot make any
other kind of cell move. We
make all our movements by
means of our muscles.</p>

<p><b>189. Where you can see
muscles.</b>&mdash;In a butcher's shop you can see lean
meat. This is the animal's muscle. White and
tough flesh divides the tender red meat into
bundles. Each red bundle is a muscle. You will
see how the muscle tapers to a string or tendon.
The butcher often hangs up the meat by the tendons.
You can see the muscles and tendons in a
chicken's leg or wing when it is being dressed for
dinner.</p>

<p>Roll up your sleeve to see your own muscles.
Shut your hand tight. You will see little rolls
under your skin, just below the elbow. Each roll
is a muscle. You can feel them get hard when
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
you shut your hand. You can feel their tendons
as they cross the wrist.</p>

<p>Open your hand wide. You can see and feel
the tendons of the fingers upon the back of the
hand. These tendons come from muscles on the
back of the arm. You can feel the bundles of
these muscles when they open the fingers. There
are no muscles in the fingers, but all are in the
hand or arm. You cannot open your hand so
strongly as you can close it.</p>

<p><b>190. Strength of muscle.</b>&mdash;By using a muscle you
can make it grow larger and stronger. If you do
not use your muscles they will be small and weak.
Children ought to use their muscles in some way,
but if they use them too much, they will be tired
out. Then they will grow weaker instead of
stronger. Lifting heavy weights, or running long
distances, tires out the muscles, and makes them
weaker. Small boys sometimes try to lift as much
as the big boys. This may do their muscles great
harm.</p>

<p><b>191. Round shoulders.</b>&mdash;The muscles hold up the
back and head, and keep us straight when we sit
or stand. A lazy boy will not use his muscles to
hold himself up, but will lean against something.
He will let his shoulders fall, and will sit down in
a heap. Sometimes he is made to wear shoulder
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
braces to keep his shoulders back. This gives the
muscles nothing to do, and so they grow weaker
than ever. The best thing to do for round shoulders
is to make the boy sit and stand straight, like
a soldier. Then he will use his muscles until they
are strong enough to hold his shoulders back.</p>

<p><b>192. How exercise makes the body healthy.</b>&mdash;When
you use your muscles, you become warmer.
Your face will be red, for the heart sends more
blood to the working muscle cells. You will be
short of breath, for the cells need more air. You
will eat more, for your food is used up. Your
muscles are like an engine. They get their power
from burning food in their own cells. When they
work they need to use more food and air. So
working a muscle makes us eat more and breathe
deeper. The blood flows faster, and we feel better
all over. The muscle itself grows much larger and
stronger.</p>

<p>If we sit still all day, the fires in our bodies burn
low and get clogged with ashes. We feel dull and
sleepy. If we run about for a few minutes, we
shall breathe deeply. The fires will burn brighter.
Our brains will be clearer, and we shall feel like
work again. Boys and girls need to use their
muscles when they go to school. Games and
play will make you get your lessons sooner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
        <b>193. How to use the muscles.</b>&mdash;You should use
your muscles to make yourself healthy, and not
for the sake of growing strong. Some very strong
men are not well, and some men with small muscles
are very healthy. Some boys have strong
muscles because their fathers had strong muscles
before them. Strength of muscle does not make
a man.</p>

<p>You ought to have healthy muscles. Then your
whole bodies will be healthy, and you can do a great
deal of work. You ought to learn how to use your
muscles rather than how to make them strong. An
awkward and bashful boy may be very strong, but
he cannot use his muscles. A boy is graceful
because he can use them.</p>

<p>The best way to use your muscles is in doing
something useful. You can help your mother in
the house and your father at the barn. You can
run errands. You can learn to use carpenter's
tools or to plant a garden. Then you will get
exercise and not know it. You will also be learning
something useful.</p>

<p>Play is also needed. Work gets tiresome, and
you will not want to use your muscles. Play is bad
when it takes you from your work or when you
hurt yourself trying to beat somebody.</p>

<p><b>194. Alcohol and the muscles.</b>&mdash;Men use alcohol
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
to make themselves strong. It dulls their weak
feelings, and then they think themselves strong.
They are really weaker. The alcohol hinders digestion
and keeps food from the cells. Then the fires
in the body burn low, and there is little strength.</p>

<p>Alcohol sometimes causes muscle cells to change
to fat. This weakens the muscles.</p>

<p>Men sometimes have to do hard work in cold
countries; and at other times they must make long
marches across hot deserts. Neither the Eskimos
in the cold north, nor the Arabs in the hot desert,
use strong drink. Alcohol does not help a man in
either place. It really weakens the body. The
government used to give out liquor to its soldiers;
but soldiers can do more work and have better
health without liquor and it is no longer given out.</p>

<p>A few years ago men were ashamed to refuse to
drink. Even when a new church building was
raised, rum was bought by the church and given to
the workmen. Farmers used to give their men a
jug of rum when they went to work. Farm hands
would not work without it.</p>

<p>Now all this has changed. Men do not want
drinkers to work for them. A railroad company
will discharge a man at once if he is known to
drink at all. A man can now refuse to drink anywhere
and men will not think any less of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
        <b>195. Tobacco</b> poisons the muscle cells and makes
them weak. At first it makes boys too sick to move.
It always poisons the cells even if they do not feel
sick.</p>

<p><b>196. A long life.</b>&mdash;A man's body is built to last
eighty years, but only a few live so long. If you are
careful in your eating and drinking, if you breathe
pure air, and if you use your muscles, your body
will be healthy and will last the eighty years and
more. All through your life you will be strong and
able to do good work.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. Muscles cover the bones and move the body.</p>
<p>2. Muscle is lean meat. It is made of bundles of

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>DISEASE GERMS</h3>

<p><b>197. Catching diseases.</b>&mdash;Our body may get out
of order like a machine. Some parts of it may be
cut, or broken, or worn out, or hurt in other ways.
Then we are sick until it is made whole again.
Sickness always means that a part of the body is out
of order.</p>

<p>Some kinds of sickness are like a fire. A small
bit of something from a sick person may start a sickness
in us, just as a spark may set a house on fire.
Then we may give the sickness to others, just as a
fire may spread to other houses. If a person has
measles, we may catch the measles if we go near him;
but if a person has a toothache, we cannot catch the
toothache from him. So we may catch some kinds
of diseases, but we cannot catch other kinds.</p>

<p><b>198. Bacteria and germs.</b>&mdash;Every kind of catching
sickness is caused by tiny living things growing in
our flesh and blood. Some of them are tiny animals.
Most of them are plants, and are called
<i>bacteria</i> or <i>microbes</i>. A common name for all of
them is <i>germs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
        The word germ means nearly the same as the
word seed. Bacteria are so small that we cannot
see them unless we look at them through a strong
microscope. Then they look like little dots and
lines (p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>). A million of them could lie on a pin
point; but if they have a chance, they may grow in
numbers, so that in two days they would fill a pint
measure.</p>

<p>Very many kinds of bacteria and other germs are
found nearly everywhere. They are in the soil and
in water, and some float in the air as dust. When
they fall on dead things, they cause <i>decay</i> or <i>rotting</i>.
When we can fruit, we kill the germs by boiling the
fruit and the cans. Then we close the cans tightly
so that no new germs can get into them. The
fruit will then keep fresh for years.</p>

<p>Decay is nearly always a good thing, for by it dead
bodies and waste substances are destroyed and given
back to the ground, where plants feed upon them.
Many plants would not grow if they could not feed
upon decaying things. So most bacteria and other
germs are useful to us. But some kinds of germs
will grow only in our bodies, and these kinds are the
cause of most of our sickness.</p>

<p><b>199. Germs of sickness.</b>&mdash;We catch a sickness by
taking a few of the germs of the sickness into our
flesh. There they grow quickly, like weed seeds in
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the ground, and form crops of new germs within a
few hours. After a few days the germs become
millions in number, and crowd the cells of our flesh,
just as weeds may crowd a potato plant (p. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>).</p>

<p>Disease germs in the body also form poisons, just
as some weeds in a field form poisons. The poisons
make us sick, just as if we had swallowed the leaves
of a poisonous weed.</p>

<p><b>200. Fever.</b>&mdash;If a sickness is caused by disease
germs, the body is nearly always too warm. Then
we say that the sick person has a <i>fever</i>. Almost the
only cause for a fever is disease germs growing in the
body. We can make a person have any kind of
fever by planting a few of the germs of the fever in
the right part of his body.</p>

<p>We are made sick by the germs of fevers more
often than by all other causes put together. Here
is a list of common diseases caused by fever germs:&mdash;colds
and sore throats, most stomach aches, blood
poisoning in wounds, boils and pimples, tuberculosis,
whooping cough, measles, chicken pox, diphtheria,
scarlet fever, typhoid fever, smallpox, and malaria.</p>

<p>Which of these kinds of sickness have you had?
What sickness have you had besides these?</p>

<p><b>201. Sickness and Dirt.</b>&mdash;Disease germs leave the
body of a sick person in three ways: first, through the
skin, second, through the kidneys and intestines, and
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
third, through the nose and throat. In these same
ways our body gives off its waste matters. If we did
not take anything from another person's body into
our own body we should not catch fevers.</p>

<p>Whatever a feverish person soils may contain
disease germs. When a person has only a slight
fever he often keeps at work, and then he may
scatter disease germs wherever he goes. So disease
germs are likely to be found wherever there is
dirt or filth. Cleanliness means good health as well
as good looks.</p>

<p><b>202. Disease germs in the skin.</b>&mdash;Disease germs
may often be found in sores and pimples on the skin,
but they will not leave anybody's flesh and blood
through sound and healthy skin. If our skin is
smooth and fair, there will be few disease germs on
it unless we rub against something dirty. A dirty
skin nearly always contains disease germs. Washing
and bathing our body will take disease germs from
our skin and help us to keep well.</p>

<p><b>203. Disease germs in slops.</b>&mdash;A great many disease
germs leave the body through the intestine and
kidneys, and may be found in the slops and waste
water of our houses. Slops are dangerous to health,
for they may run into a well, or spring, or river, and
so carry disease germs into our drinking water
(p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>). Also, house flies may light on the pails
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
or puddles and carry the germs to our food. In
these ways we catch typhoid fever, stomach aches,
and other diseases of the intestines. All slops and
waste matters from the body should be put where
they cannot reach our drinking water, and where
flies cannot crawl over them (p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>).</p>

<p><b>204. Disease germs from the nose and throat.</b>&mdash;If
a person is sick with a fever, many of the germs are
likely to be found in his nose and throat. Thousands
of them are driven out with every drop of
saliva and phlegm when he blows his nose, or
spits, coughs, or sneezes, or talks. If he puts anything
into his mouth, it will be covered with germs.
More diseases are spread from the nose and mouth
than in any other way, for we are always doing
something to spread bits of saliva and phlegm.</p>

<p><b>205. Spitting.</b>&mdash;Colds and consumption and other
forms of sickness are often spread by sick persons
spitting on the floor or pavement. The germs become
dried and are blown away as dust. For this
reason dust from the streets of cities and in crowded
halls is often the cause of sickness. In many places
spitting on a floor or pavement is strictly forbidden
by law.</p>

<p><b>206. Putting things in the mouth.</b>&mdash;Many persons
have the habit of sucking their fingers, or of touching
a pencil to the tongue when they write or think,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
or of wetting their fingers with their lips when they
turn the leaves of a book. In all these ways we may
give a disease to others or may take a disease from
some one else.</p>

<p><b>207. Public drinking cup.</b>&mdash;When you touch your
lips to a cup, you leave some saliva and cells from your
mouth on the cup. If a cup is used by a number
of persons, some one is almost sure to leave germs
of sickness on it, and others are likely to take them
into their own mouths when they drink. So a public
drinking cup is a dangerous thing. Each school
child should have his own cup. Public drinking
fountains should be so made that we may drink by
putting our lips to a stream of running water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
        <b>208. Sweeping.</b>&mdash;Dusty air in a room is dangerous
to health, for disease germs are likely to be
found in it. We can get rid of dust by keeping our
floors swept clean. After sweeping we should wipe
the dust from the tables and furniture. A feather
duster or dry cloth will only stir up the dust and
make it float in the air again. We should use
either a damp cloth, or a dry duster made of tufts
of wool, so that the dust will stick to the duster.</p>

The hairs on its body and legs catch<br />
dirt and disease germs.</p>
</div>

<p><b>209. Foul air.</b>&mdash;If we live in a closed room, the
air soon becomes
foul and dusty,
and is likely to
have disease
germs in it. Foul
air is one of the
greatest of the
causes of sickness.
We should
change the air of
a room often so as
to keep it fresh
and free from dust
and disease germs
(pp. <a href="#Page_65">65</a>&ndash;<a href="#Page_67">67</a>).</p>

<p><b>210. House flies.</b>&mdash;House flies come from garbage
heaps and filth of all sorts. So they carry disease
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
germs on their bodies. They light on our food
and on our faces, and so they often make us sick.
They are often the cause of typhoid fever, stomach
aches, and stomach sickness in babies.</p>

<p>Flies are hatched in manure piles and garbage
heaps. At first they look like white worms, and
are called <i>maggots</i>. Every maggot is a young fly.
We can get rid of flies by cleaning up every garbage
heap and manure
pile.</p>

<p><b>211. Mosquitoes.</b>&mdash;Mosquitoes
carry malaria and
yellow fever from
sick persons to
the well. If there were no mosquitoes, there would
be no malaria or yellow fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
        Mosquitoes are hatched in water, and the young
are called <i>wigglers</i>. We may often see them in
rain barrels. We may get rid of mosquitoes by
emptying all rain barrels and pails and cans of dirty
water, at least once a week, and by drying up
swamps and marshes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>PREVENTING SICKNESS</h3>

<p><b>212. How our body kills disease germs.</b>&mdash;We take
disease germs into the body in three ways: first,
through the mouth, second, through the nose, and
third, through the skin. So we should watch the
purity of our food, drink, and air, and should be
careful about putting things into the mouth, and
about the cleanliness of the skin. We often take a
few disease germs into the body without catching
a disease. This is because the white cells of our
blood fight the germs and kill them (p. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>). If
the body is hurt or weakened, the white blood cells
may also be weakened so that they cannot kill the
germs. We should take good care of the body so
that every part of it may do its work well. We need
not be able to run fast, or to lift heavy weights, but
the best sign that every part of the body is in good
order is to feel bright and wide-awake. Then our
white blood cells will also be in good order and able
to fight disease germs.</p>

<p><b>213. Catching cold.</b>&mdash;When we catch a disease, we
often say that we have caught cold. We used to
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
think that cold air and dampness were almost the
only causes of taking cold, and this is the reason
why we called many kinds of sickness by the name
of colds. Now we know that we catch cold by taking
disease germs into the body. The germs will not be
able to grow unless the body is weakened in some
way, as by cold and dampness. Yet if we are wet
and cold, we shall not catch cold unless we take
disease germs into the body. We do not get the
germs from the outdoor air, for very few germs are
there. We get them from the foul air of our houses
when we come in to warm and dry ourselves. If the
air of our houses were always as clean and pure as
the outdoor air, we should hardly ever have colds.</p>

<p>We can safely let the cold air blow on us if we are
out of doors, but if we sit in a house, a small draft
sometimes seems to make us take cold. This is
because there are likely to be many disease germs
in the house and few out of doors.</p>

<p>Other things besides cold air and dampness may
weaken the body, and so help us to take cold. If
germs of colds are in a warm room, we may sit there
and take cold even if we are not wet or chilled at all.
The body may be weakened by poor food, wrong
eating, or overwork, so that disease germs will easily
grow in it. We take as many colds from these
causes as from cold air and dampness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
        <b>214. Kinds of colds.</b>&mdash;A person takes most of the
germs of colds through his nose and mouth. If
they grow only in his nose, we say that he has a
cold in his head. If they grow in his throat, he has
a sore throat, or tonsillitis. If they reach as far as
the upper part of his windpipe, he is hoarse, or has
a cough, or the croup. If the germs are planted in
his lungs, he may have bronchitis or pneumonia.
All these kinds of sickness often spread from one
person to another. If one person in a family has a
cold, others in the family often catch cold from him.</p>

<p><b>215. Diseases like colds.</b>&mdash;Diphtheria, tuberculosis,
whooping cough, and measles all begin like a
common cold and often look like a cold during the
whole sickness. Colds do not turn into any of these
diseases, for each of them comes from its own germ,
just as corn comes only from seed corn.</p>

<p><b>216. Curing a cold.</b>&mdash;If you have a cold, you ought
to stay at home and rest, or lie in bed. Then your
white blood cells can gain strength to fight the disease
germs. You ought to have plenty of fresh air
in your room. You ought not to eat much food
for a few days, so that your stomach and intestine
and liver can use all their strength in throwing
off the poisons of the germs. But you ought
to drink plenty of water, so as to help wash away
the poisons from your body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
        <b>217. Keeping colds from spreading.</b>&mdash;You should
keep away from other persons while you have a
cold, or other catching disease, so as to keep from
spreading the sickness. You ought not to go visiting,
or go to school, or to church, or to other meeting
places. When you cough or sneeze, you should
hold a handkerchief to your mouth, so as to keep
from blowing disease germs from your throat and
nose. You ought to sleep in a bed by yourself, so
that no one may take the disease germs from your
bedclothes. No one else should use your towel, or
handkerchief, or knife, or fork, or spoon, or dish,
until they have been washed in hot water, so as to
kill the disease germs on them.</p>

<p><b>218. Keeping from catching cold.</b>&mdash;You can keep
yourself from catching cold by keeping your body
strong and in good order. You should keep your
clothes dry, eat good food, breathe pure air, get
good rest and sleep, and keep your body, your
clothes, and your house clean. You should also
keep disease germs out of your body. You should
not form a habit of putting your fingers or a pencil
to your mouth (p. <a href="#Page_127">127</a>). You should keep your
nose, your throat, and your mouth clean.</p>

<p><b>219. Cleanliness of the nose.</b>&mdash;The inside of the
nose is wet with a slippery liquid. If you have a cold,
the liquid is thick and stops your nose, and is called
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<i>phlegm</i>. The liquid catches and holds dust and
disease germs, and keeps them from going into the
windpipe. It also kills many of the disease germs.</p>

<p>You should always carry a handkerchief and use
it so as to blow the germs out of your nose. You
should have a clean handkerchief every day.</p>

<img src="images/i0136-illus.jpg" width="150" height="208" alt="View of nose and throat" title=""/>
<p class="caption"><b>Photograph of model of the<br />nose and throat.</b><br />

</div>

<p><b>220. Adenoids and large tonsils.</b>&mdash;Sometimes children
have large tonsils growing in the back of the
throat, or soft
bunches of flesh
called <i>adenoids</i>
back of the nose.
These children
cannot breathe
well through the
nose, but must
breathe through
the mouth. Then
they take dust
and disease germs
deep into the
body, and so take
colds and other
sickness easily.
If a child has adenoids
or large
tonsils, an operation should be done to take them out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
        <b>221. Cleanliness of the mouth.</b>&mdash;We often breathe
dust and disease germs into the mouth or snuff them
into the throat from the nose. Then they are caught
between the teeth and in the folds of the cheeks and
throat. There they may grow, and finally go deeper
into the body and make us sick. A dirty mouth is
very often the cause of colds and other sickness.</p>

<p>We should keep our mouths clean by brushing our
teeth with a toothbrush two or three times a day.
We should also rub the toothbrush over the tongue
and around the back part of the throat so as to clean
the germs from every part of the mouth. Each child
should have a toothbrush of his own, and should
use it every day.</p>

<p><b>222. Contagious diseases.</b>&mdash;Diphtheria, whooping
cough, measles, scarlet fever, and smallpox are all
dangerous kinds of sickness, and spread with great
ease. The germs may float in the air, and we may
take them into our bodies if we go into a room where
any one has the sickness. So we call these diseases
<i>contagious</i>. If a person has one of these diseases,
he should be made to stay in a house or room by
himself until he is well. Keeping the sick away from
well persons is called <i>quarantine</i>. When the sickness
is cured, the sick room and everything in it
should be cleaned and washed so as to kill the germs.</p>

<p><b>223. <a name="Board" id="Board"></a>Board of health.</b>&mdash;There is a board of health
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in every city and town. The men on the board show
persons how to keep diseases from spreading, and
make them obey the rules of health. Everybody in
a town should help the board of health in every
possible way.</p>


<h3>WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>1. The white blood cells of our body kill disease
germs.</p>
<p>2. We catch cold by taking disease germs into our
body.</p>
<p>3. The germs of colds are not often found in the
air out of doors. They are often found in the
foul air of houses.</p>
<p>4. If a person has a cold, he should keep away from
other persons, so as to keep from spreading
the sickness.</p>
<p>5. Cleansing the nose helps us to keep from catching
cold.</p>
<p>6. Cleansing the teeth and the inside of the mouth
removes many disease germs.</p>
<p>7. Adenoids and large tonsils should be taken from
the throat by an operation.</p>
<p>8. If a person has a dangerous contagious disease,
he should be quarantined.</p>
<p>9. Boards of health have charge of the prevention
of contagious diseases.</p>
